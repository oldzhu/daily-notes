Done — origin now points to your repo and the local commit is pushed.

Remote updated to https://github.com/oldzhu/llm-cpp.git
Pushed branch main to origin/main
Set upstream tracking (main now tracks origin/main)
If you want, I can also verify by fetching and showing the remote commit hash matches local (git rev-parse HEAD; git ls-remote origin main).
