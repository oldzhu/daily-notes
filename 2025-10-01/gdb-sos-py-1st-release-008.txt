$ git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "gdbsos v0.1.0: let gdb do .n
et managed debugging"
$ git push origin v0.1.0
assume I use the above commands to push v* tag and it triggered the github build/package/release action, but failed at some step, then I troubelshoot and fix the issue, how to retriggered the action to run?

===========

You’ve got a few good options to re-run the release workflow after fixing things:

Fastest options
Re-run the failed run (same commit/workflow version):
GitHub UI: Actions → the failed “Release” run → Re-run all jobs (or Re-run failed jobs).
CLI:
List runs and re-run:

gh run list --workflow Release --limit 5gh run rerun <run-id>
Watch:

gh run watch <run-id> --exit-status
Note: Re-run uses the workflow file version from the original run’s commit. If you changed the workflow file, those changes won’t apply with a simple re-run.

Use your updated workflow (recommended after workflow fixes)
Manually dispatch the workflow with the tag input:
GitHub UI: Actions → Release → Run workflow → enter tag v0.1.0 → Run.
CLI:

gh workflow run Release -f tag=v0.1.0gh run list --workflow Release --limit 1gh run watch <new-run-id> --exit-status
This triggers the workflow on the latest main (or default branch) version of the workflow file while building artifacts for the specified tag.

Retagging (only if you really need another tag push)
If you prefer to trigger via push again, create a new tag (recommended):

git tag -a v0.1.1 -m "gdbsos v0.1.1"git push origin v0.1.1
Avoid force-moving a published tag; if you must, delete and recreate:

git tag -d v0.1.0git push origin :refs/tags/v0.1.0git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "gdbsos v0.1.0 (re-tag)"git push origin v0.1.0
Heads-up about release assets
Your workflow uploads tarballs to the same tag release. If a previous failed run already created assets, re-runs may fail on “file already exists” unless you:

Delete existing assets from the GitHub release page before re-running, or
Set overwrite in the workflow’s release step (softprops/action-gh-release):
Add this under “Upload release assets”:

overwrite: true
Or bump the tag (v0.1.1) to change asset names.
Pick the method that fits your change: quick “Re-run” for transient failures; “Run workflow” with tag input to pick up updated workflow logic.- Or bump the tag (v0.1.1) to change asset names.
