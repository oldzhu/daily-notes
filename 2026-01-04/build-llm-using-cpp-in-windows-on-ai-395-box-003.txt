Yes — I added the missing parts as a new teaching doc, and I also baked in the “docs contract” so future features always get paper/formula→code explanations.

What I Added

docs/autograd_and_memory_layout.md
Row-major memory layout + indexing formulas (with worked examples)
How this repo’s autograd graph is built and executed (Tensor, Node, topo order, GradMode)
Examples mapping core derivatives to code loops (add, matmul2d, softmax JVP, cross-entropy gradient)
Attention tensor shapes and what indices are contiguous (important later for performance/GPU)
A concrete checklist for future features so docs stay aligned with code/papers
Docs Index Updated

docs/README.md now links the new doc and explicitly states the rule:
when we add MHA / KV-cache / RLHF / etc., we also add/update docs so learners can map concept → formula → code.
Verification

Re-ran ctest (Debug): all tests passed.
If you want, before we implement multi-head attention, I can also add a lightweight “doc template” file (headings + required sections) so each new feature doc is consistent and easy to write.
