Mostly yes, but not all of it is currently “verbatim” in the repo.

Included as docs (already in the project):

docs/transformer_math_to_code.md covers the core paper-style mapping:
embeddings, pre-norm block structure, causal self-attention equations, cross-entropy, AdamW update
plus “where in code” pointers (functions/files)
docs/training_and_inference_walkthrough.md covers the runtime flow:
train loop, generation loop, checkpoint overview
Included as code comments (already in the project):

Softmax / LayerNorm / Attention / Cross-Entropy comments are in src/ops.cpp
Block structure + embedding/head comments are in src/model.cpp
AdamW equation comment is in src/optim.cpp
Not fully included yet (I explained it here, but we haven’t written it down in-repo in full detail):

The deeper “autograd engine walk-through” (how the topo order is built, how each op attaches a backward lambda, how gradients accumulate) is not yet documented as a dedicated section.
A concrete “shape + memory layout” worked example (e.g., B=2,T=4,C=8 indexing into flat arrays) is also not yet a doc.
If you want, I can add one more doc file like docs/autograd_and_memory_layout.md that captures the missing parts (autograd flow + buffer indexing examples) in the same teaching style, then re-run ctest again.
