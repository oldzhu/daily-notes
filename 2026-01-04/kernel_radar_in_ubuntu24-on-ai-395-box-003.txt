Done

Initialized a new git repo at mylinux/kernel_radar (not at ~/mylinux and not in WSL2-Linux-Kernel).
Committed the current project files as: bbf039c kernel_radar: add wrapper + opt-in scheduling.
Confirmed .venv/, reports/, and config.yaml were not committed (they’re ignored).
Removed the mistaken empty ~/mylinux/kernel_dara directory.
If you want, I can also add a short note in the README about keeping config.yaml local-only (already ignored) and using config.example.yaml as the shareable template.
