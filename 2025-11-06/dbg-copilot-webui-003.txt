it is better now and another issue is lldb and gdb output color mode in dbgcopilot, now in webui, the output of gdb and lldb in dbg cmd output are white-black, it is possible to make their output display the same as their colorful display in dbgcopilot?
===========

Debugger panes now receive raw ANSI output so colors render like native GDB/LLDB.

session_manager.py: preserve ANSI sequences when forwarding debugger output, trimming only the echoed prompt via an ANSI-aware regex before appending the backend prompt.
Tests: pytest -q.
Next: reload the web UI and run a color-heavy GDB/LLDB command to confirm the terminal renders as expected.

==============

the debugger output box just display raw ansi output directly as the below and seems in webui there is no colors render like native GDB/LLDB....

===============

Fallback console now parses ANSI escapes so you still get colored debugger output when xterm.js isn’t available.

app.js: added lightweight ANSI parser/renderer and updated the fallback terminal prompt/output to convert escape codes into styled spans while keeping the raw text for accessibility hints.
styles.css: introduced matching foreground/background color classes and formatting rules so the rendered spans mimic the debugger palette inside the fallback console.
Tests: pytest -q.

Next: hard-refresh the web UI (clears cached styles.css) and re-run a color-heavy LLDB/GDB command; if colors are still missing, check the browser console for CDN load errors so we can decide whether to keep relying on the fallback renderer or restore xterm.
