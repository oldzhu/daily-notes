Your updated workflow is now in good shape: both pickers support dynamic title filters at runtime, and they print the extid so you can immediately pick one candidate and feed it into the repro tooling.

Dynamic filters live in tools/syzbot_pick_top3.py and tools/syzbot_pick_unclaimed.py via --include-title-re / --exclude-title-re (exclude defaults to the existing “hardware-ish” regex).
“Choose one to work” is enabled because output now includes extid: ... (I smoke-tested this; it prints as expected).
Practical next steps (end-to-end):

Pick 3 “unclaimed” with a custom rule: .[syzbot_pick_unclaimed.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/5) --count 3 --include-title-re 'rcu|net|bridge' --exclude-title-re 'usb|wifi'
Check whether one has patches in flight: .[syzbot_check_in_progress.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/6) --extid <EXTID>
Scaffold a runnable QEMU repro bundle: .[syzbot_prepare_qemu_repro.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/7) --extid <EXTID>
Reference docs if needed: docs/how-we-picked-top-3-syzbot-issues.md and docs/how-we-picked-unclaimed-syzbot-issues.md
If you want, I can add a one-shot helper script that does “pick 3 → prompt/select 1 → auto-run repro prep” using the existing tools.
