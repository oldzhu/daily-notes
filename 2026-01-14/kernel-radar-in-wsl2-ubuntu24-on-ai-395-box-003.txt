What I documented

Added a new short “today” note: docs/2026-01-14-syzbot-picker-area-filters.md
Captures the new area-focused picking knobs (--include-subsystem*, --include-title-re, --no-exclude-title) and concrete examples for cgroup/namespaces/scheduler/GPU.
Also appended targeting examples to:
docs/how-we-picked-top-3-syzbot-issues.md
docs/how-we-picked-unclaimed-syzbot-issues.md
What I committed

Commit: 57ba57f — “tools: add subsystem/title filters to syzbot pickers”
Includes updates to:
tools/syzbot_pick_top3.py
tools/syzbot_pick_unclaimed.py
plus the docs above
Working tree is clean now.
Tomorrow we can start by running .[syzbot_pick_unclaimed.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/3) --count 3 --include-subsystem cgroup (or the other areas) and pick one extid to prep with ./tools/syzbot_prepare_qemu_repro.py --extid <extid>.
