let us temporary hold on source mapping before we figure out how lldb plugin clru source mapping works. Let us begin to work on to remove requirement which is our py files and libsosgdbbridge.so have to be in the same folder as libsos.so and SOS debugger extenstion. Now what I want to is they can be in different folder. I mean our py files and libsosgdbbridge.so can be in one folder such as gdbsos or in our repo artifacts/bin/linux.x64.[config] and libsos.so and SOS extensions can be inother folder. Now the question is how to detect the folder for libsos.sos and SOS extensions
