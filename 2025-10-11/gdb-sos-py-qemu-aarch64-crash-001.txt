The docker-desktop WSL distribution is not built from a user-accessible Dockerfile. It is a specialized, internal distribution created and managed directly by the Docker Desktop application to run the Docker daemon. Since it's a proprietary part of Docker Desktop, its source for this specific function is not publicly available like an open-source image
