Add support for using lldb besides gdb - prefer most prompts can be shared between different debuggers, lets us avoid write debugger specific prompts in commont prompts unlesee necessary.As we add more debuggers into our dbgcopilot, I am considering to change the way how dbgcopilot is launched, currently we launch dbgcopilot as gdb/lldb plugin or extension,I would like to change to launch dbgcopilot as main standalone which gives copilot> prompt 1st and then the user can choose to use which debugger from the debuggers our dbgcopilot supported(gdb/lldb/other debugger), then dbgclopliot will start and copperate with the started debugger the user choose.
