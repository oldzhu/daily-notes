Nice—since 1 and 2 are done and tested, I’ve kickstarted item 3 by adding an LLDB backend and plugin, and I’ll outline the standalone launcher plan next.

actions taken
Implemented LLDB support (in-process) with shared prompts

lldb_inprocess.py
LldbInProcessBackend: runs LLDB commands via the Python API (SBCommandInterpreter)
Placeholder outputs when not inside LLDB so it’s safe in tests
copilot_cmd.py
Adds a copilot command to LLDB via command script add -f ...
New session initialization identical to GDB flow
repl.py
LLDB nested copilot> REPL mirroring the GDB REPL
/prompts, /exec, /goal, and /llm subcommands (list/use/models/model/key) for parity
Reused the same prompts across debuggers

The backend name is “lldb”, which gets injected into {debugger} placeholders in prompts
No LLDB-specific prompt variants required for the default flow
OpenRouter helper

src/dbgcopilot/llm/openrouter.py: added list_models(session_config) to fetch models
Extended /llm subcommands

In both GDB and LLDB REPLs: /llm models, /llm model, /llm key
Build/tests/commit

Tests: PASS
Rebuilt and reinstalled the wheel (local)
Committed all changes on branch main
try it in LLDB
Inside lldb:

Load copilot and start REPL
command script import dbgcopilot.plugins.lldb.copilot_cmd
copilot
Optional: set provider and API key
/llm use openrouter
/llm key openrouter sk-or-xxxxx
/llm models
/llm model openai/gpt-4o-mini
Natural language flow is the same as in GDB; proposals are single-step with backticks + description; <cmd> executes and echoes “lldb> …” for parity.
standalone launcher plan (phase 2)
Goal: Launch dbgcopilot standalone, show copilot> first, user selects debugger (gdb/lldb/other), then dbgcopilot cooperates with that debugger.

Design outline:

Backends
Keep the DebuggerBackend Protocol generic (already in place).
Add out-of-process backends to drive debuggers without embedding:
GdbSubprocessBackend: run gdb -q, interact via pexpect; send lines, capture outputs; handle prompts and pagination settings.
LldbSubprocessBackend: run lldb -Q, interact via pexpect in a similar manner.
Session lifecycle hooks:
initialize_session() sends baseline settings (pagination off, widths, etc.)
Standalone REPL (new)
File: src/dbgcopilot/repl/standalone.py
Console REPL (outside any debugger) with:
/debuggers: list supported backends (gdb, lldb)
/use <debugger>: spawns the chosen debugger subprocess backend and initializes session
/attach <pid> or /file <path> convenience commands that translate to debugger-native commands
Reuse /llm, /prompts, /colors exactly as in current REPLs
Entry point: console_script “dbgcopilot”
Starts copilot> with no backend selected; prompts user to choose /use gdb or /use lldb
Prompt sharing
Keep the shared prompts as-is with {debugger} injection
Optional lightweight debugger-specific “hints” injected via rules if certain commands differ (e.g., LLDB ‘bt’ vs ‘thread backtrace’), but prefer model to learn mapping from outputs and rules
Safety and UX
gdb> and lldb> echoes remain for executed commands to keep familiarity
Robust output capture and truncation (head_tail_truncate exists)
Context overflow reset remains the same; summarization still available
Phased delivery

Phase 2a (MVP): Standalone REPL + GdbSubprocessBackend only
Phase 2b: Add LldbSubprocessBackend
Phase 2c: Quality-of-life (attach/file helpers), docs, examples
what’s next
If you’re good with this plan, I’ll implement Phase 2a:
Create the standalone REPL
Implement GdbSubprocessBackend (pexpect-based)
Wire a new console script “dbgcopilot”
Quick smoke test with examples/crash_demo/crash
After that, Phase 2b adds LldbSubprocessBackend similarly.
Want me to proceed with Phase 2a now?
