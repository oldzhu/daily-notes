1. prompt to not propose the next command if user just ask to run some commands even if there is error in the output of the executed command.
2. add list and switch between the models supported in openrouter.
3. /cmd - pass all cmds not in the copilot command list to backend debugger directly.
4. add modelscope free model support.
5. adding lldb or other debugger - prefer most prompts can be shared between different debuggers, try to void write debugger specific prompts in commont prompts.
6. summary and new session still not working - temporarily disable the function by setting a very large context limit
7. press up and down key does not go through typed history in copilot>
8. Add local llm support

design thinking:
copilot: user, debugger(may be other tools compiler,git, how to call different tools in copilot? mcp?), llm model

hard mode - usr drive
easy mode - llm model drive - fullatuo mode on this
