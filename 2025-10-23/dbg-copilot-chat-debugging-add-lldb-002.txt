On it—pushing Phase 2b forward with LLDB in the standalone REPL, plus a quick note on the current capture behavior and next iteration options.

What I implemented
LLDB subprocess backend

File: lldb_subprocess.py
Starts lldb, disables color, sets a simple prompt, enables auto-confirm, and captures output until the prompt returns.
Supports multi-command inputs split on newlines/“;”.
Standalone REPL wired to LLDB

File: standalone.py
New command: /use lldb which starts the LLDB subprocess backend and initializes the orchestrator.
Help text updated accordingly.
README: updated to mention /use lldb in the standalone REPL and show a quick usage snippet (already present).

Try it
Start the standalone REPL:

dbgcopilot
In the prompt:

copilot> /use lldbcopilot> /exec help helpcopilot> /exec thread backtrace
Note: In this container, LLDB’s interactive output via a pseudo-tty is inconsistent—commands may return blank or minimal output. This varies by LLDB build and terminal stack. The implementation is shipped but marked experimental.

What I tested
The GDB subprocess backend works end-to-end and returns expected content.
LLDB subprocess initialization succeeds, but its captured output in this environment returns empty/whitespace for typical commands like “help help” and “version.” I added color disabling and a robust prompt regex, but the behavior persists here.
Next iteration options
If you want me to continue iterating now, I can:

Harden LLDB subprocess capture
Add an ANSI-aware, space-tolerant prompt match with dual-pattern fallback (custom and default).
Add a “double expect” technique: if the first capture is empty, read again to handle delayed print.
Add a config to toggle a minimal “pager-free” mode and optionally inject a newline after each command (some builds flush on input).
Provide a graceful fallback mode for LLDB in standalone
Detect consistently empty outputs and suggest switching to the in-process LLDB plugin via dbgcopilot-lldb for that session.
Small UX polish
After /use lldb, display a short “[experimental]” tip if the first few commands produce no output.
Your call: want me to keep tightening the LLDB subprocess backend now, or proceed to the next phase (e.g., a combined “copilot>” choosing debugger + future auto-run hooks)?
