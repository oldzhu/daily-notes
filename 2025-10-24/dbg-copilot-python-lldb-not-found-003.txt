so why python lldb api works in inprocess lldb is becuase the liblldb* is already loaded in lldb process before import lldb in our lldb plugin?
===========
Added 1 todo

Short answer: yes — in-process LLDB already has the native liblldb runtime loaded and the LLDB-internal Python environment already wired up, so importing the Python "lldb" package works there. In a standalone Python process you must reproduce two things the in-process environment provides: (1) the Python wrapper package directory on sys.path and (2) the native liblldb shared library visible to the dynamic linker (or preloaded into the process) so the extension module _lldb can load.

Here’s a concise explanation plus debugging/fix steps you can run.

Why it works inside LLDB (in-process)
- LLDB is a C++ program that embeds a Python interpreter or runs Python code inside a process that already has liblldb loaded.
- The embedded interpreter runs after the native liblldb is initialized; therefore the Python extension module (_lldb) can bind to liblldb’s symbols immediately. There’s no dynamic loader problem.
- The in-process environment also sets up the Python-side package (sys.path) correctly (often via `lldb -P` or internal logic), so `import lldb` resolves both the pure-Python wrapper and the compiled extension.

Why it can fail in standalone Python
- The Python package (pure-Python files) may be present (e.g., in /usr/lib/.../site-packages), but the compiled extension _lldb (a .so) depends on liblldb being available via the system dynamic loader.
- If liblldb is missing or not on LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or its directory not in the system default search locations), the interpreter fails to load the extension and you get:
  - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_lldb' or
  - ImportError: cannot import name '_lldb' from partially initialized module 'lldb' (circular import symptoms) — the latter often shows up when the import of the extension fails and Python then re-enters module init, producing a partially-initialized module state.
- Version/ABI mismatch: the _lldb extension must be built against the same Python version and compatible liblldb.

How to confirm / debug (commands to run)
- Show the Python path the package expects:
  - lldb -P
- Inspect the extension file:
  - ls -l /usr/lib/llvm-18/lib/python3.12/site-packages/lldb/_lldb*.so
- See which liblldb shared objects exist:
  - ls -l /usr/lib/llvm-18/lib/liblldb*.so*
- Check dynamic dependencies of the extension:
  - readelf -d _lldb.cpython-312-x86_64-linux-gnu.so | grep NEEDED
  - or ldd on the .so:
    - ldd /usr/lib/llvm-18/lib/python3.12/site-packages/lldb/_lldb.cpython-312-*.so
- Check what `lldb -P` prints and verify that directory contains the lldb package:
  - python3 -c 'import sys; print(sys.version); print(sys.executable)'
  - lldb -P

Concrete fixes and examples
- Preferred short fix (recommended for testing): Run standalone Python with PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH set from lldb -P and libdir:
  - Find the Python package path:
    - lldb -P
  - Find liblldb dir, e.g. /usr/lib/llvm-18/lib (adjust to what you have)
  - Run:
    - LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-18/lib PYTHONPATH="$(lldb -P)" /path/to/venv/bin/python -c "import lldb; print('OK', lldb.__file__)"
- Preload liblldb into the process (what we tried in the repo code):
  - In Python you can do:
    - import ctypes; ctypes.CDLL('/usr/lib/llvm-18/lib/liblldb.so.18', mode=ctypes.RTLD_GLOBAL); import lldb
  - This forces the loader to resolve liblldb symbols globally, letting the extension bind.
- Install system packages so the library is in standard loader locations:
  - sudo apt install lldb liblldb-18 python3-lldb-18
- Use conda (recommended for reproducible envs):
  - conda install -c conda-forge lldb
  - Conda will place liblldb and the Python package where the conda Python can see both.
- Use the packaged launcher we provide (`dbgcopilot-lldb`) or run `dbgcopilot` while exporting PYTHONPATH="$(lldb -P)" so the REPL finds the right wrapper.

Why you saw the specific errors
- "No module named 'lldb'": initial venv didn’t have the lldb package on sys.path.
- After inserting site-packages, Python tried to import the wrapper, which in turn tries to import the compiled `_lldb` extension. If that extension fails to load due to missing liblldb, you often get ModuleNotFoundError for _lldb and later an ImportError complaining about a partially-initialized module because of the failed initialization sequence.

Extra tips
- Use readelf/ldd to confirm the extension expects liblldb and whether that file exists.
- If you have multiple LLVM versions installed, ensure the lldb Python package and liblldb come from the same LLVM version (e.g., both llvm-18).
- If you want a one-liner you can try now (adjust site-packages/lib dir if different):
  - LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-18/lib PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/llvm-18/lib/python3.12/site-packages python -c "import lldb; print('OK', lldb.__file__)"
- If that still fails, run:
  - python -c "import importlib, sys; p='/usr/lib/llvm-18/lib/python3.12/site-packages'; sys.path.insert(0,p); import importlib; m=importlib.import_module('lldb'); print(m.__file__)"
  - plus ldd/readelf on _lldb.so as described above.

If you want, I can:
- Run those ldd/readelf commands here and inspect the exact dependency failures.
- Add a small helper to `dbgcopilot` that prints the discovered `lldb -P` and liblldb locations and suggests the exact LD_LIBRARY_PATH/PYTHONPATH command to use for your venv.

Which would you like me to do next? Run the ldd/readelf checks now and paste results, or add a REPL helper?
