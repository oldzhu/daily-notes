Agree with the direction—using the LLDB Python API is the right default. I’ve added an LLDB API backend and made the standalone REPL prefer it; for packaging, we should keep it an optional runtime requirement rather than a hard dependency.

What I changed just now

New backend: lldb_api.py
Creates an SBDebugger, runs commands via SBCommandInterpreter/SBCommandReturnObject, and returns strings directly (no pexpect).
Better error hint if lldb isn’t importable (Ubuntu/macOS/Conda install tips).
Standalone REPL uses API-first:
Updated /use lldb in standalone.py to try LldbApiBackend first and fall back to the subprocess backend only if the lldb module isn’t available.
Docs: added “LLDB Python API (optional)” section to README with install steps and clarified that API is preferred with subprocess fallback.
Why not make it a hard package requirement?

The lldb Python module is tied to system LLVM/LLDB distributions and Python ABI; it’s not reliably installable via pip across platforms.
If we declare it in install_requires, many environments will fail to install our package even if users only want GDB.
Best practice: treat it as an optional runtime dependency and auto-detect. We already do this (API backend first; fallback to subprocess), plus we show a helpful install message if import lldb fails.
What “final release” should include

Runtime detection: already implemented (API-first; fallback; clear error guidance).
Documentation: done (README section with install commands).
Optional extras: We should avoid adding a pip extra for “lldb” since there isn’t a universal PyPI package. If you want, we can add a docs-only extra name (e.g., [lldb-api]) but not populate it with a package to avoid pip resolution failures—this is mostly cosmetic.
How to install the LLDB Python API (summarized)

Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install lldb python3-lldb # or python3-lldb-<version> depending on distro
macOS:
xcode-select --install
xcrun python3 -c 'import lldb; print(lldb.version)'
Conda:
conda install -c conda-forge lldb
Files changed

src/dbgcopilot/backends/lldb_api.py: new API-based backend
src/dbgcopilot/repl/standalone.py: prefer API backend for /use lldb, fallback to subprocess
README.md: clarified LLDB support and added installation section for the LLDB Python API
Quality gates

Lint/typecheck: PASS (no new errors reported on edited files)
Tests: the existing smoke test still passes by import paths (only GDB import is required there)
If you want, I can also:

Add a one-liner in the /use lldb fallback messages suggesting how to install the lldb module on the current OS.
Gate the LLDB subprocess backend behind a short “consecutive empty output” auto-suggest to switch to in-process (if running inside lldb) or to install the API bindings.
