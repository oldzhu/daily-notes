is there gdb dev package which has headers files so I can develop gdn related staffs?

Yes üëç ‚Äî there is a GDB development package, but its availability and name depend on your Linux distribution.

GDB itself is mostly a standalone debugger, but if you want to build tools that embed GDB or interact with it at the API level, you need the GDB development headers. These typically come in a -dev or -devel subpackage.

Common distros:

Debian / Ubuntu

Package name:

gdb
gdb-multiarch      # if you need cross-arch support
gdb-source         # sources with headers (optional)


‚ö†Ô∏è Debian/Ubuntu do not split out a clean libgdb-dev. The GDB public API is not considered stable, so you usually need to build GDB from source if you want to use libgdb.a and headers (e.g., bfd.h, gdb.h, etc.).

Fedora / RHEL / CentOS

Package:

gdb
gdb-headless
gdb-doc
gdb-devel   # this is the dev package with headers and .a/.so for embedding


dnf install gdb-devel will give you the headers.

Arch Linux

The gdb package includes everything (no separate -dev). If you want headers explicitly, you may need to pull from gdb-src or build.

If you need to build tools "related to GDB"

The official embedding API is called the GDB/MI interface (Machine Interface). You don‚Äôt need headers for this, just talk to GDB via pipes.

If you want to link against libgdb (e.g., to embed GDB inside your program), you really do need the development headers ‚Üí on most distros that means building from source.

‚úÖ Summary:

On Fedora/RHEL: install gdb-devel.

On Debian/Ubuntu: there is no official gdb-dev ‚Äî you must use the GDB source package (apt-get source gdb) and build to get headers.

For most "GDB-related stuff" (frontends, automation), you should prefer GDB/MI instead of embedding.

Do you want to embed GDB inside your application, or just control it externally (like writing a frontend/debugging tool)? The answer changes which route you should take.

I would like to make gdb debugger to support .net core debugging when debugging? which way I need to select  to move forward? using GDB/MI interface or something else?

Short answer: don‚Äôt build this on plain GDB or GDB/MI. The supported path for .NET on Linux is LLDB + SOS, or you can reuse an existing managed debugger like NetCoreDbg.

Here‚Äôs why and what to pick:

What GDB/MI gives you (and doesn‚Äôt)

GDB/MI is just a machine-readable control interface to GDB (start/stop/step, breakpoints, inspect memory). It doesn‚Äôt add .NET runtime semantics (managed stacks, GC roots, objects, types, async state machines, etc.). You‚Äôd still need a managed runtime data layer, symbol readers, and a lot of CLR knowledge.

The official, supported route

Microsoft‚Äôs .NET diagnostics stack on Linux uses LLDB with the SOS extension. SOS understands the CLR and exposes commands like clrstack, dumpheap, gcroot, etc., for both live processes and core dumps. You install it via dotnet-sos and load it into LLDB. If you want robust .NET debugging today, build on LLDB+SOS.

Typical setup (for reference):

dotnet tool install -g dotnet-sos ‚Üí dotnet-sos install, then use LLDB; SOS provides the managed views.

If you want a GDB-like experience for .NET

Consider NetCoreDbg. It‚Äôs an open-source .NET Core debugger that already implements GDB/MI and the Debug Adapter Protocol, with CLR awareness built in. You can drive it programmatically (via MI) or integrate via DAP‚Äîfar less work than teaching raw GDB about .NET.

Recommendation matrix
Goal	Best path
Build tooling that can actually debug .NET (managed stacks, heap, types) on Linux	LLDB + SOS (official & well-documented)
Provide a CLI or programmatic debugger with MI/DAP endpoints	NetCoreDbg (reuse their MI/DAP + CLR logic)
Extend GDB itself to understand .NET	Not recommended (you‚Äôd have to re-implement CLR data access & SOS-like features)

If you tell me your end target (CLI tool, VS Code integration, remote dump analysis, embedding in another app), I can sketch the concrete architecture and give code pointers (LLDB/SOS command flows or NetCoreDbg MI/DAP sequences).

I know can use python to extend the gdb debugging commands, what python gdb extension is using to interactive with gdb? GDB/MI or something else? Besides Python, any other way to extend gdb debugging commands?

Great question!

What Python in GDB actually talks to

GDB‚Äôs Python support uses GDB‚Äôs in-process Python API (the gdb module). It does not go through GDB/MI. Your Python runs inside the GDB process and calls objects like:

gdb.Command, gdb.Parameter ‚Äì define new commands & tunables

gdb.Value, gdb.Frame, gdb.Inferior, gdb.Thread ‚Äì inspect program state

gdb.Breakpoint & gdb.events.* ‚Äì set breakpoints, react to stops, etc.

gdb.execute("...") ‚Äì run any CLI command and capture its output

Pretty-printers (gdb.printing), frame filters, type printers, xmethods, auto-loading via foo-gdb.py, etc.

So: Python extensions interact with GDB directly via its embedded API, not MI.
(MI is for external front-ends driving GDB over pipes, e.g., IDEs.)

Other ways to extend GDB

Guile (Scheme) scripting

An alternative embedded language, similar capabilities to Python (commands, printers, events), via the guile module.

User-defined CLI commands (built-in mini language)

In .gdbinit or sourced scripts:

define mycmd
  commands...
end
document mycmd
  help text
end


Good for simple macros, but far less powerful than Python/Guile.

External front-ends via GDB/MI

Write a separate process (IDE, TUI, service) that starts GDB with --interpreter=mi2 and speaks the MI protocol over stdin/stdout.

This drives GDB but doesn‚Äôt add in-process commands; you implement features in your app and translate to MI.

Patching or embedding GDB (C/C++)

There is no stable C plugin ABI for drop-in modules. If you need new low-level capabilities in C/C++, you typically:

Patch GDB itself and rebuild, or

Embed GDB (link libgdb) in your app‚Äîpossible but not a stable/public API and generally discouraged for third-party tooling.

Pretty-printers shipped with your types

You can auto-load Python pretty-printers by placing *-gdb.py alongside your binaries/libraries; GDB will auto-discover them to render custom structures nicely.

Which to choose?

In-process extensions (Python/Guile): best when you want new GDB commands, custom printing, stack/heap analysis, breakpoint logic, etc.

MI: best when you‚Äôre writing an external tool/IDE that controls GDB.

C/C++: only if you‚Äôre willing to patch/rebuild GDB or take on unsupported embedding.

If you tell me what you want your extension to do (e.g., inspect CLR objects, new pretty-printers, async-aware stacks), I can sketch the Python skeleton (commands, event hooks, printers) to get you started.
