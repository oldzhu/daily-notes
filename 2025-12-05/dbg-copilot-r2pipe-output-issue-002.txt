See above, after the code change, we lost WARN, INFO and SIGNAL msg in dbgcopilot REPL comparing with the below output whe run the same in radare2 direcly

[0x00001080]> ood
WARN: Environment corrupted after null bytes injected via r_sys_setenv2

=======

Captured radare2’s stderr correctly now. The reader thread decodes bytes from the patched r2pipe process and feeds them into the command response, so /exec ood and /exec dc mirror the CLI (WARN/INFO before ood, SIGNAL immediately after Crash demo…). Verified with a direct backend run.
test_radare2_fixes.py re-run after the fix: now shows WARN lines and correct ERROR messages without blanks; note the script still prints the initial “Relocs” warning (same as native radare2). pytest tests/test_smoke_structure.py also passes.
You shouldn’t need to reinstall again unless more edits occur; the current wheel already contains the updated stderr capture.
Let me know if you want me to tune out the cursor-mode escape codes (\x1b[?1000…) from the warnings, but functionally the REPL should now display the full sequence.
