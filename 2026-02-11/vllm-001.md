Generated the report + skill script, but there are no open, unassigned issues matching labels native-kernels or custom-ops in vllm-project/vllm right now. The report reflects that.

Created:

Skill script: vllm/scripts/skill_issue_triage_native_ops.py
Report: vllm/reports/issue-triage-native-ops-20260211.md
Report (ZH-CN): vllm/reports/issue-triage-native-ops-20260211.zh-CN.md
How do you want to broaden the search so I can still pick 10 candidates?

Include assigned open issues with those labels.
Use open issues mentioning native ops (title/body contains csrc, custom ops, kernel).
Use different labels (tell me which).
Search both upstream + your fork.
