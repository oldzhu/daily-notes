A few ways to speed this up from China:

Shallow clone only what you need:

git clone --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/oldzhu/ollama.git
If you need history later: git fetch --unshallow
Use a proxy/mirror that fronts GitHub:

git clone https://ghproxy.com/https://github.com/oldzhu/ollama.git
Or set once: git config --global url."https://ghproxy.com/https://github.com/".insteadOf "https://github.com/"
If you only need the code snapshot (no Git history), download a tarball via proxy:

curl -L https://ghproxy.com/https://github.com/oldzhu/ollama/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -o ollama.zip
Ensure your git uses HTTPS (not SSH) if your SSH path is slower.

Try the shallow + ghproxy clone first; it usually brings the biggest speedup.
