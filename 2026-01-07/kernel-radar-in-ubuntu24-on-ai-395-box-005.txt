Yes — there are follow-ups, and they’re good news.

What I can see programmatically (bypassing the blocked lore search page)

Your patch thread Atom feed t.atom shows 3 entries (your patch + 2 replies).
The thread mbox t.mbox.gz confirms 2 replies from Peter Zijlstra.
Follow-up summary

Peter replied that he picked up your patch.
He noted it needs to include the generated-file updates from running ./scripts/atomics/gen-atomics.sh, and he showed what the resulting combined patch looks like.
Second reply: he noticed and fixed a “spurious” generated change (gen-atomic-fallback.sh vs gen-atomic-fallback.sh).

What you should do next

No v2 needed from you right now. The maintainer already took it and is adjusting the generated outputs on his side.
Optional (nice): send a short reply like “Thanks, noted about generated files; I’ll include them next time.”
