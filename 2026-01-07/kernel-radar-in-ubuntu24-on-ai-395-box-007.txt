Ran git send-email with VS Code askpass disabled (env -u GIT_ASKPASS ... GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=1 ...)
You confirmed the prompt (Send this email? ...: y)
SMTP accepted it: Result: 250 (success) with Message-ID <20260107101033.45302-1-oldrunner999@gmail.com>
If you want to avoid the interactive “Send this email?” prompt next time, set:

git config --global sendemail.confirm auto
And if you want to avoid being asked for the SMTP password each time, we can set up a safer credential mechanism (without putting the password in command line or VS Code askpass).
