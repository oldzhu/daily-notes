Yes — besides updating tools/syzbot_check_in_progress.py, I also created a new script (and doc) to preserve the “list and filter 3 unclaimed issues” logic that previously only existed as ad‑hoc terminal snippets.

What’s new

New script: tools/syzbot_pick_unclaimed.py

Implements the exact filtering we used:
Must have ReproC or ReproSyz
Heuristic exclude hardware-ish titles
“Unclaimed” == syzbot page does not link to any lore /T/ thread whose subject contains [PATCH
Run: ./tools/syzbot_pick_unclaimed.py --count 3 --scan-limit 2000
New doc: docs/how-we-picked-unclaimed-syzbot-issues.md

Explains the heuristic, limitations, data sources, and how this script relates to the other tools.
Also updated

Refined syzbot_check_in_progress.py (already pushed earlier) so it only flags “in progress” if a linked lore thread subject actually contains [PATCH] (instead of treating every /T/ as patch-like).
All of the above is committed and pushed to your GitHub repo, so tomorrow when you pick which issue to start, we can rerun syzbot_pick_unclaimed.py and then confirm with syzbot_check_in_progress.py before doing any reproduction work.
