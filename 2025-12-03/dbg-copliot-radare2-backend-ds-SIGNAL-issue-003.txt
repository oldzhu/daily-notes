`/chatlog` only replays `SessionState.chatlog`, which stores the user/assistant conversation coming from the LLM. The debugger output (including the `[+] SIGNAL 11 …` line) is routed through `state.debugger_output_sink` and is not appended to `chatlog`. That’s why you can see the signal banner in the REPL console (and dbgweb debugger frame) but not when you run `/chatlog`.

Relevant bits:

- standalone.py, `_install_output_sink`: debugger output is sent to `_dbg_sink`, which just echoes it to stdout; it never touches `state.chatlog`.
- `/chatlog` handler (same file, lines ~915–930) prints only the entries in `state.chatlog`, i.e., user and assistant lines.
- The signal text arrives in `run_command()` (thanks to the stderr capture we added) and is visible anywhere the debugger sink goes, but it won’t appear in `/chatlog` unless we explicitly modify the REPL to log debugger output there as well.

If you’d like `/chatlog` to show debugger output too, we could extend the handler to include `state.pending_outputs` or record debugger chunks into a separate log. Right now, its behavior is “LLM transcript only,” so what you’re seeing is expected even with the updated backend.

========

Correct. Every debugger command result—now including the [+] SIGNAL 11 … banner—gets forwarded to the orchestrator via state.debugger_output_sink, so the LLM receives it in the “Debugger output” section of the follow-up prompt. That’s why the assistant can describe the segmentation fault even though /chatlog doesn’t show it. /chatlog simply replays the user/assistant conversation (the entries stored in state.chatlog); it doesn’t include the debugger streams. If you want the signal text to appear there as well, we’d need to extend the REPL to log debugger output into chatlog or add a new command that dumps both conversation and debugger history.
