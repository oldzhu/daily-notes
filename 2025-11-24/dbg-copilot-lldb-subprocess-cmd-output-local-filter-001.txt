Thanks and I tested, basically it works fine and one thing I want to fix:

Locating external symbol file: ld-linux-x86-64.so.2...
Parsing symbol table: ld-linux-x86-64.so.2...
Locating external symbol file: 0e05878220fb2fc6d28ff46b63b3fd5d48e763.debug...
Locating external symbol file: 0e05878220fb2fc6d28ff46b63b3fd5d48e763.debug...
Reading binary from memory: [vdso]...
Locating external symbol file: <Unknown>...
Parsing symbol table: <Unknown>...

the above lines only appearred in lldb subprocess output capture for the command run and not appearred in lldb if run the command directly. so Basizlly let us filter them out locally too(do not left empty lines), what I mean is to filter out the lines which start with the below text:
Locating external symbol file:
Parsing symbol table:
Reading binary from memory:
In addition, I saw still no color in lldb subprocess output but it is color when run the same command in lldb directly

=======
Filtered LLDB subprocess output now also drops the extra “Locating external symbol file…”, “Parsing symbol table…”, and “Reading binary from memory…” lines while trimming blank rows, and the filtering runs on ANSI-stripped text but keeps the original, colored bytes in the final output so the REPL retains LLDB’s colorized responses.
Color handling is left to the existing /colors toggle (the backend no longer force-disables color on startup), so enabling colors in the client now shows the same ink as native lldb.
Tests: backend smoke checks already exercised via the earlier python … LldbSubprocessBackend runs; no new automated tests added.
