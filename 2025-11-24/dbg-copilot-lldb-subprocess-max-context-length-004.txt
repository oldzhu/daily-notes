====
Extended the transcript filter in CopilotOrchestrator._llm_turn so repeating log lines like the DWARF indexing spam collapse before the prompt is sent; the new helper normalizes each line (removing [N/M] counters and squeezing whitespace) and only keeps a single [repeat …×] … summary when a sequence of ~10+ normalized lines repeats, keeping the context length hairier events compact without losing signal.
Updated the repeat-collapsing helper rather than just comparing raw strings, ensuring streams such as [4419/4420] Manually indexing DWARF: libc.so.6… now register as one summary entry instead of 4,400 near-identical lines.
Tests: not run (not requested).
