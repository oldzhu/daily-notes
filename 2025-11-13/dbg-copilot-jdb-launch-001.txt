I would like to change some behavirs when /use jdb is selected.
change
copilot> /use jdb
Enter path to .java/.class/.jar or main class:
to
copilot> /use jdb
Enter class path to .class/.jar: <input path is required>
Enter source path to .java(optiona):<input path is optional>
validate the input path is exist or not
then start jdb as jdb -classpath <input class path> -sourcepath <input source path>
only pass sourcepath in case if it is input and validate

====
Jdb Setup Improvements

Updated /use jdb in standalone.py to ask for a required classpath and optional sourcepath, validate both paths, and store them in the session config.
Expanded JavaJdbBackend (java_jdb.py) to accept the new sourcepath parameter and automatically add -sourcepath whenever launching jdb, including class, directory, and jar modes.
Tests: pytest -q

Next up, you might rebuild the Java demos (make crash-java, make hang-java) and try /use jdb with the new prompts to ensure the workflow feels right.

====
more changes besides the above for jdb launch in copilot and webui

for copilot:
copilot> /use jdb
Enter class path to .class/.jar: <input path is required>
Enter source path to .java(optiona):<input path is optional>
Enter Main class(optional): <input Class name>
then jdb would like launch jdb -classpath <classpath> [-source path <input source path>] [input class name]
for webui
when select jdb, then the program input element would changed to 3 inpupt elements:
classpath //required
sourcepath //optional
class name //optional
I also would like to change elements size and font size in explore frame to be smaller so more content can be displayed in the screent of the frame.

========

Enabled the web app and backend session wiring to require a classpath for /use jdb, aligning it with the REPL prompts and tightening the explorer layout.

Updated session_manager.py to accept optional classpath/sourcepath, pass them into JavaJdbBackend, keep jdb config fields, and skip auto-loading binaries for jdb.
Adjusted routes.py so session creation forwards the new payload fields and prefers an optional main class when launching jdb.
Added dedicated classpath/sourcepath/main-class inputs in index.html, toggling them from app.js based on the selected debugger, including workspace picker integration, validation, and payload serialization.
Shrunk explorer/UI spacing and styled the new inputs in styles.css.
Restored _validate_path as a module-level helper in standalone.py so REPL validation works again.
Ensured jdb program autoload is suppressed, preventing an invalid file command.
Tests not run (repo instructions didn’t request them).
Next: 1) Run pytest -q to confirm nothing regressed. 2) Start a jdb session via the web UI to confirm the new prompts and validation behave as expected.
