Java Jars Added

Extended Makefile and Makefile so each build now produces both class files in java and a runnable JAR in jar (sets Main-Class via jar cfe …).
Added directory creation, tool checks, and clean-up for the new artifacts.
Tests/Builds: make crash-java, make hang-java, pytest -q

Next step: run /use jdb with Crash.jar if you’d like to confirm jar debugging flows.
