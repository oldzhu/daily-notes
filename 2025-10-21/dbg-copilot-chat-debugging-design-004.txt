Love that idea—color makes the flow much clearer. I added optional colored output with a simple toggle and kept raw GDB output unmodified to avoid masking important details.

What you get now

Assistant replies in green
Command echoes in cyan and bold (both <cmd> execution and /exec)
Errors in red
Raw debugger output stays as-is (no color), so “Reading symbols…/Starting program…” look exactly like native GDB
/colors on|off to toggle
/debuginfod on|off (from previous step) to get debuginfod messages when desired
Try it

In your current GDB session:
copilot> /colors on
Ask: “load examples/crash_demo/crash and run”
You’ll see:
Cyan bold echo of file … and run
Native GDB output in default colors (Reading symbols…, Starting program…, etc.)
Use /colors off to disable coloring at any time.
/debuginfod on if you want download messages.
Notes

Coloring is controlled by a new session flag colors_enabled (default on).
Chat transcript (/chatlog) is stored without ANSI codes; only printed REPL output is colored. That keeps logs clean and copy/paste friendly.
If you’d like, we can tweak colors to your taste (e.g., magenta for assistant, gray for boilerplate) or add a /theme command later.
Want me to set a different color scheme or adjust which lines get colored?
