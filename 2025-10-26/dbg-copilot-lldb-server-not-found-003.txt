Thanks for the log — I’ll make LLDB find lldb-server reliably by discovering the right settings dynamically and, on Linux, avoid requiring llgs for local runs when possible. I’ve applied the fixes and here’s what’s next.

actions taken
Updated lldb_subprocess to:
Discover all LLDB settings that reference “lldb-server” via settings list and set each one to the detected path (instead of relying on a few fixed keys that may not exist on your LLDB build).
Keep a fallback list of known keys if discovery yields nothing.
Best-effort: disable using llgs for local launches on Linux to avoid needing lldb-server at all:
settings set platform.plugin.linux.use-llgs-for-local false
Updated lldb_api to use the same dynamic “settings list” discovery so API and subprocess are consistent.
These changes address the “unable to locate lldb-server-19.1.7” even when LLDB_SERVER_PATH is set, and they’ll work across LLDB variants where the exact setting keys differ.

try it
Since you already have LLDB_SERVER_PATH=/usr/bin/lldb-server-19, just rerun the REPL and verify LLDB sees the server:

dbgcopilot/use lldb/exec settings list | grep -i lldb-server/exec settings show platform.plugin.linux.use-llgs-for-local/exec platform status/exec run
Notes:

You should now see one or more entries in the first command (e.g., target.lldb-server, plugin.process.gdb-remote.lldb-server[-path], or platform.plugin.remote-linux.lldb-server) showing the path you provided.
If platform.plugin.linux.use-llgs-for-local exists on your build, it should show as false (which bypasses needing lldb-server for local debugging).
if it still fails
Try pointing LLDB_SERVER_PATH to the exact file you have installed (you’ve done this with lldb-server-19, which is correct).
Verify path exists:
Optional: ls -l /usr/bin/lldb-server* /usr/lib/llvm-*/bin/lldb-server*
As a last-resort compatibility shim, a symlink can help if LLDB is probing an exact versioned filename:
Optional: create a symlink like /usr/bin/lldb-server-19.1.7 -> /usr/bin/lldb-server-19 (only if needed).
quick status
What changed: both LLDB backends now automatically discover and set all “lldb-server” settings that exist in your LLDB build; subprocess backend also disables llgs-for-local on Linux when available.
Expected outcome: settings list | grep -i lldb-server shows the configured path; run no longer errors about locating lldb-server-19.1.7.
Once you rerun the above checks, paste the outputs for:

/exec settings list | grep -i lldb-server
/exec settings show platform.plugin.linux.use-llgs-for-local
/exec platform status
if anything still doesn’t look right, and I’ll adjust the detection accordingly.
