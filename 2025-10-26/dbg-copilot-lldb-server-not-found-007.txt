ok after testing, I think I know the cause now

lldb in process mode - can find lldb-server-19.1.7
lldb sub process mode - can not find lldb-server-19.1.7
actually both modes will to launch lldb-server one succeeded and on e failed. It is becuase in lldb iprocess mode, as lldb launced 1st and run command will try to launch the lldb-server-19.1.7 from the same folder as lldb binary itself (which is /usr/lib/llvm-19/bin/lldb) and then succeeded, for the lldb sub proess, as we use the python api to launch the target applcaition under lldb-server 1st, as it has no idea where is lldb-server-19.1.7 so it failed to launch lldb-server. based on this research, I think we have two workarounds:
export LLDB_DEBUGSERVER_PATH=/path/to/lldb-server-19.1.7
add the path of where the lldb-server-19.1.7 is to the PATH environment
could we implment that workaaround into our code when using lldb api backend?

===========

Great investigation. Your read is spot-on: when driven via the Python API, LLDB ends up using the gdb-remote path and needs to locate lldb-server; the in-process CLI finds it because it resolves relative to the lldb binary directory.

Here’s a minimal, review-ready plan to implement your two workarounds in the LLDB API backend, without changing any behavior unless helpful and with an easy opt-out.

proposal: API-only env autoconfig (no code changes yet)
What it does (Linux):
If LLDB_SERVER_PATH or LLDB_DEBUGSERVER_PATH is already set:
Prepend its directory to PATH so LLDB can find the exact filename it wants.
Else, try to auto-locate lldb-server by:
Finding the lldb binary path (via shutil.which("lldb")) and checking its sibling directory for:
lldb-server-<full-version>, lldb-server-<major>, lldb-server
Checking /usr/lib/llvm-<major>/bin for the same candidates
If found, set both LLDB_SERVER_PATH and LLDB_DEBUGSERVER_PATH to the discovered binary and prepend that directory to PATH.
Opt-out: DBGCOPILOT_LLDB_AUTOCONFIG=0 disables this logic entirely.
Scope: Only in LldbApiBackend.initialize_session (subprocess backend unchanged).
Tiny contract:

Input: current process env; filesystem; lldb --version
Output: possibly modified os.environ[PATH], LLDB_SERVER_PATH, LLDB_DEBUGSERVER_PATH
Success: LLDB API launches target locally without “unable to locate lldb-server-…”
Failure: If nothing found, it’s a no-op; behavior stays as-is.
Likely edge cases handled:

Only “lldb-server-<major>” exists (no full patch version) → we still set ENV and PATH to point at it.
Settings keys for lldb-server don’t exist on your build → we don’t rely on them at all.
You’ve already set LLDB_SERVER_PATH/LLDB_DEBUGSERVER_PATH → we respect it and just ensure PATH includes the directory.
where this fits in code (sketch only)
In LldbApiBackend (e.g., at the top of initialize_session):

Compute version and binary dir:

version_full from subprocess "lldb --version" (e.g., 19.1.7), plus major (19)
lldb_bin = shutil.which("lldb"); lldb_dir = os.path.dirname(lldb_bin)
Candidate directories: [lldb_dir, f"/usr/lib/llvm-{major}/bin"]

Candidate names: [f"lldb-server-{version_full}", f"lldb-server-{major}", "lldb-server"]

If LLDB_SERVER_PATH or LLDB_DEBUGSERVER_PATH present:

Prepend its dirname to PATH
Else:

For dir in dirs:
For name in names:
if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(dir, name)):
env["LLDB_SERVER_PATH"] = env["LLDB_DEBUGSERVER_PATH"] = that path
Prepend dir to PATH
break
Respect DBGCOPILOT_LLDB_AUTOCONFIG=0 to skip the whole step.

This keeps it simple, local, and version-agnostic, and mirrors the “LLDB CLI finds sibling lldb-server” behavior you observed.

confirm the approach
If this matches what you want, I’ll implement exactly this in the LLDB API backend, behind the DBGCOPILOT_LLDB_AUTOCONFIG flag and with careful fallback and no-op behavior when nothing is found. I’ll avoid touching the subprocess backend and won’t introduce any of the earlier experimental settings toggles.

Want me to proceed with the patch?
