pls roll back all code changes u tried to fix the error unable to loate the lldb-server-19.1.7, as non of them works, I will try to create sym link to lldb-server-19 and then see if it works, one interesting thing is lldb standalone works (why it not try lldb-servre-19.1.7?), anyway, I will debug and troubeshoot the error, I think the workable soltuion should be based on the root cause we figured out.
=======
Got it — I’ve rolled back the lldb-server-specific changes so you can proceed with your own symlink-based debugging.

Here’s exactly what I reverted

lldb_subprocess.py

Removed the temporary PATH/symlink trick for lldb-server-<version>.
Removed platform select host and the dynamic “use-llgs” disabling.
Replaced dynamic “settings list” discovery with the previous simple attempt to set a small fixed set of keys (best-effort, ignored if not present).
Kept unrelated, earlier improvements (like preserving script commands).
lldb_api.py

Removed the temporary PATH/symlink trick prior to LLDB API init.
Removed platform select host and dynamic “use-llgs” disabling.
Reverted lldb-server config to the earlier fixed-keys approach.
Kept other behavior intact (safe import probe, etc.).
Build/lint quick check

PASS: No errors detected in the two edited files.
Optional: your manual symlink approach

If your LLDB expects the exact filename lldb-server-19.1.7 but your system has only lldb-server-19, a symlink can help:

sudo ln -s /usr/bin/lldb-server-19 /usr/local/bin/lldb-server-19.1.7# or, if the binary is elsewhere, point the source to the real path
You can also prepend a temp directory with that symlink to PATH if you prefer not to write to /usr/local/bin.
Notes

Your observation is spot on: your standalone lldb might not require the exact versioned lldb-server or may find it differently (PATH, internal fallback, or build flags). Our earlier attempts tried to cover many LLDB variants; since your build doesn’t expose those settings, the symlink is a clean way to confirm the root cause quickly.
If you hit anything puzzling after adding the symlink, share the exact outputs from:

lldb --version
which lldb-server; ls -l /usr/bin/lldb-server*
The failing lldb run command and error text
I’ll align the backends with whatever root cause you uncover.
