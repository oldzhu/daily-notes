Moving the QEMU helper assets into qemu so they live alongside our test assets and removing the old copies to avoid confusion.

actions taken
Created qemu and added:

meta-data — cloud-init meta
user-data — cloud-init config (installs .NET 8 SDK arm64, gdb, lldb; sets 9p mount; create user “dev”)
README.md — end-to-end steps to download the Ubuntu ARM64 image, generate the seed ISO, and run QEMU with host repo mounted at workspaces
Removed the old duplicates from qemu:

meta-data
user-data
README.md
Paths in the README are updated to point at qemu.

where to find it now
Cloud-init seeds:
meta-data
user-data (remember to paste your SSH pubkey)
Guide:
README.md
If you want small launch helpers next (e.g., src/tests/qemu/make-seed.sh and src/tests/qemu/run.sh that auto-detect firmware paths and the cloud image), I can add them.
