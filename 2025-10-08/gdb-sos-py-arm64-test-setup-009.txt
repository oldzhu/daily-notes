seems that makes the things complex,let us choose to use username dev with empty password to simplify the testing image preparaing, pls help to modify user-data to support dev without password and also remove the logic to create/use the ssk pub key in prepare.sh

=====
Acknowledged. I switched our VM seed to use the “dev” user with an empty password and removed the SSH key dependency from the prep flow.

changes made
user-data

Removed ssh_authorized_keys.
Enabled SSH password auth and empty passwords:
ssh_pwauth: true
Ensure PasswordAuthentication yes and PermitEmptyPasswords yes in sshd_config.
passwd -d dev to make the password empty.
Restart SSH.
Added openssh-server to packages to ensure the SSH service is present.
Kept existing .NET SDK, gdb/lldb, and 9p mount setup.
prepare.sh

Removed all SSH public key generation/injection logic.
Now simply copies the seeds/helpers, builds seed.iso, and prints the run command.
Prints a note that password-based SSH is configured (empty password for user dev).
how to use now
Recreate the seed and launch:
prepare.sh
(cd src/tests/qemu/testspaces && ./run.sh jammy-server-cloudimg-arm64.img seed.iso)
SSH in after cloud-init finishes:
ssh -p 2222 dev@127.0.0.1
When prompted for password, just press Enter (empty password).
If StrictHostKeyChecking prompts, answer “yes” on first connect.
Security note

This setup is only for local testing. The VM is bound to localhost:2222 in the examples, but an empty password is inherently insecure—don’t expose this VM to untrusted networks.
If you want, I can add a short “Security notes for local testing” block to the QEMU README to make the risk explicit and show how to switch back to SSH keys later.
