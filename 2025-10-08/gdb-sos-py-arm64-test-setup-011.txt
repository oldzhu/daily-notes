user-data
Updated fstab entry to mount 9p at gdbsos instead of workspaces.
Ensure both workspaces and gdbsos exist before mounting.
README.md
Updated all references, manual mount example, and usage paths to gdbsos.
Example GDB source path updated to sos.py.
next steps
Regenerate the seed ISO so the new mount path applies on next boot:
Run prepare.sh again (this copies user-data and rebuilds seed.iso in testspaces/).
Boot the VM with run.sh from testspaces.
Inside the VM, your repo will be at gdbsos.
If you need a manual mount in the VM:

sudo mkdir -p /workspaces/gdbsos
sudo mount -t 9p host /workspaces/gdbsos -o trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L,msize=262144,cache=mmap
All setâ€”your VM and devcontainer paths are aligned.
