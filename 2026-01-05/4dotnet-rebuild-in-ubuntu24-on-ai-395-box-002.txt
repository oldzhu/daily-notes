Result

Container image build is now working with Ubuntu 24.04, and Buildroot defconfig works inside the container.
What happened in testing

.[run.sh](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) --build initially failed due to flaky/blocked network access to Ubuntu apt repos during Docker build.
Using host networking fixed it: BUILD_NETWORK=host [run.sh](http://_vscodecontentref_/1) --build succeeded.
Buildroot external tree config parses fine in-container:
.[run.sh](http://_vscodecontentref_/2) -- make BR2_EXTERNAL=/work/4dotnet defconfig BR2_DEFCONFIG=/work/4dotnet/savedconfigs/arm64/br2.defconfig wrote /work/buildroot/.config successfully.
What I changed to make this reliable

Added BUILD_NETWORK support in the wrapper so you can do BUILD_NETWORK=host ... --build when Docker build networking is restricted.
Added support for passing proxy env vars and optional apt mirror overrides (APT_MIRROR, APT_SECURITY_MIRROR) during image build.
Updated docs with these troubleshooting knobs: build-container.md.
Next

If you want, I can run a short “first few minutes” build smoke test inside the container (e.g., start make and stop after toolchain download begins) to confirm the workflow beyond defconfig—without committing to a full multi-hour build.
