let us temporarily hold on set up the daily run, and keep the manual run for POC 1st, I just would like the next thing of the project is to pick up top 3 issues can choose to start working on, the select rule would be:

simple and direct
no special hardware requirement
has a repro so that it would be easy to verfiy the fix
try to review the relatead code and modify the code to fix.
expain why the fix would work and wait for my review to approve.
once the fix proved to work,follow the proess to submit the change to kernel.
let me know what is ur plan and suggesttions

I just want to quickly to start to submit my 1st kernal patch and verify the workflow to contribute to kernel work, before continue to run script to proceed, I would like to know what the workflow will be and any other tools are required to install to patch the kernel through the standard workflow.
==========
Goal: get your first kernel patch sent via the standard email workflow, with the right metadata and a sane local test, so you can verify the “submit → review → v2 → accepted” loop.

Workflow (minimal, standard)
1) Pick a tiny change
Best first patch: docs typo / warning fix / small selftest fix.
Keep it “obviously correct”, easy to review, no special hardware.
2) Create a clean branch
git checkout -b my-first-patch
3) Make the change + build/test something relevant
At least make W=1 for the affected area (or make help target + quick build).
If it’s selftests: run that selftest.
4) Format + validate
Run style checks (at least checkpatch.pl).
Ensure commit message follows kernel conventions (Fixes:, Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org only if appropriate).
5) Find the right recipients
Use get_maintainer.pl on the touched files to get maintainers + mailing lists.
6) Generate the patch
git format-patch -1 --subject-prefix="PATCH" --cover-letter (cover letter optional for 1 patch).
7) Send via email
Prefer b4 send (uses git send-email under the hood) or directly git send-email.
8) Respond to review
Make fixes, send v2, keep the same subject thread (“Re: [PATCH v2] …”).
9) Track
Follow the thread on lore.kernel.org; keep notes of feedback + what changed.
Tools you should install (recommended)
These make the workflow much smoother:

git + build tools
git, gcc/clang, make, bc, bison, flex, libssl-dev, libelf-dev, pahole (for BTF), etc. (depends on your config).
email + patch sending
git-email (package name varies; on Ubuntu it’s usually git-email)
msmtp (simple SMTP sender) or configure SMTP inside git directly
b4 (highly recommended)
Pulls patch series from lore, prepares replies, and can send patches.
Great for kernel-email workflow in 2025/2026.
patch tooling
patchutils (optional)
ripgrep (rg) for searching, cscope/ctags optional
Commands you’ll actually use on day 1
Inside your kernel tree (or any kernel repo you’ll submit against):

Recipients:
.[get_maintainer.pl](http://_vscodecontentref_/3) -f path/to/file.c
Style:
.[checkpatch.pl](http://_vscodecontentref_/4) -g HEAD
Patch file:
git format-patch -1
Send (two common ways):
git send-email 0001-*.patch --to ... --cc ...
b4 send -o /tmp/outgoing --to ... --cc ... (or b4 send directly if configured)
Practical suggestions for your very first patch
Start with a doc or trivial warning fix in the upstream kernel tree you’re targeting.
Don’t start with AMDGPU behavior changes as patch #1 unless it’s purely obvious (comment/doc/build warning), because review cycles can be longer and hardware questions come up.
Two quick questions so I can tailor the exact “first patch” recipe
Are you planning to send your first patch to upstream mainline (kernel.org) or to the WSL2 kernel tree first?
Do you already have an SMTP method working (Gmail app password / Outlook SMTP / msmtp), or do you want the simplest setup?
If you answer those, I’ll give you a precise checklist with the exact packages + config steps for your distro, and we can pick a “starter patch” candidate that fits your criteria (simple + no special hardware + easy verification).
