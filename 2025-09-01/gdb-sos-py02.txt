Nice. Taking the win and lining up crisp next steps you can pick from when you’re ready:

IMemoryRegionService (enables gctonative/findpointersin/maddress)

Implement in the native bridge using /proc/<pid>/maps + ELF symbolization; wire to NativeAddressHelper.
Start minimal (read-only regions + basic symbol resolve), expand as needed.
dso accuracy

Trace stack root enumeration; double-check thread context (RIP/RSP/RBP), partial reads, and any missing ILLDBServices callbacks.
Add a tiny “diagnose-dso” trace mode to log root discovery.
Command parity + UX polish

Audit vs LLDB list; fill any gaps/synonyms; ensure “help” and “soshelp” surface everything users expect.
Optional: add command aliases where WinDbg casing differs.
Symbols and hosting

Make setsymbolserver/loadsymbols flow smooth under GDB.
Auto-detect managed hosting readiness and print a one-liner hint only when needed.
Perf/robustness

Cache module lookups and /proc maps; keep ReadVirtual partial-read behavior but cap retries.
Add lightweight error codes-to-hints for common failures.
Packaging/docs/tests

Single-line import instructions; env var table (SOS_LIB_PATH, SOS_BRIDGE_LIB_PATH, SOS_PY_*).
Add a few smoke tests (clrstack, dumpobj, dumpheap) against the SimpleThrow sample.
Which one should we tackle first? My vote: IMemoryRegionService (unlocks 3 commands) or dso accuracy, depending on your priority.
