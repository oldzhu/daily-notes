I notice we're still at the same instruction `0x634bf824617d` and haven't progressed. The rflags register shows `0x00010246` which includes some additional flags. Let me try stepping one more time to trigger the actual segmentation fault:
[+] SIGNAL 11 (aka SIGSEGV) errno=0 addr=0x00000000 code=1 si_pid=0 ret=0

We're still stuck at the same instruction. The debugger might be having issues executing the instruction that causes the segmentation fault. Let's check if there are any signals pending and try to continue execution to see the actual crash:
[+] SIGNAL 11 (aka SIGSEGV) errno=0 addr=0x00000000 code=1 si_pid=0 ret=0

The debugger seems to be stuck at the instruction that causes the segmentation fault. Let's try a different approach - instead of stepping, let's continue execution to let the crash happen naturally:
[+] SIGNAL 11 (aka SIGSEGV) errno=0 addr=0x00000000 code=1 si_pid=0 ret=0

The debugger seems to be stuck or not showing the expected crash output. Let me check the current state and see if we've actually crashed. The instruction at `0x634bf824617d` should cause a segmentation fault when it tries to write to address 0x00000000.
