The reason you are seeing that error is that **`go run`** is designed for testing, not for installing.

When you execute `go run . server`, Go compiles your code into a **temporary file**, runs it immediately, and then **deletes it** as soon as the program stops. It never actually places an `ollama.exe` in your folder or adds it to your system path.

To actually "install" it so you can use the `ollama` command anywhere, you have two main options:

---

### Option 1: Build it manually (Best for developers)

If you want the executable to stay in your current folder (`C:\localrepos\ollama`), run this command instead:

```powershell
go build -o ollama.exe .

```

* **What this does:** It creates a permanent file named `ollama.exe` in your current directory.
* **How to run it:** You can now run it by typing `.\ollama.exe` (the `.\` tells Windows to look in the current folder).

---

### Option 2: Install it to your Go path

If you want to be able to type `ollama` from **any** folder without the error, run:

```powershell
go install .

```

* **What this does:** It compiles the code and moves the executable to your Go binary folder (usually `C:\Users\<YourUser>\go\bin`).
* **The Result:** Since that folder is typically already in your Windows "Path," you will be able to run `ollama` from any command prompt.

### Why the command failed just now

1. **Missing Executable:** `go run` cleaned up after itself, so there is no `ollama.exe` on your disk.
2. **Environment Path:** Even if you use `go build`, Windows doesn't look in `C:\localrepos\ollama` by default when you type a command. You have to tell it where to look.

### Recommended Next Step

If you just want to use Ollama like a normal user, I recommend running **`go build -o ollama.exe .`** first.

Would you like me to show you how to add your `localrepos` folder to your **Windows Environment Path** so that your custom builds work globally?
