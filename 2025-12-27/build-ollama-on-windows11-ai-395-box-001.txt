I build ollma and run it and saw the below output

C:\localrepos\ollama>go run . server

go: downloading github.com/spf13/cobra v1.7.0

go: downloading github.com/rivo/uniseg v0.2.0
==========
When you run `go run . server` for a project like Ollama, the output you're seeing is Go's module system automatically fetching the **dependencies** (libraries) required to build and run the application.

### What are these downloads?

These are **Go Modules**. Instead of building everything from scratch, developers use these pre-made libraries to handle specific tasks:

* **`github.com/spf13/cobra`**: Handles command-line commands and flags.
* **`github.com/gin-gonic/gin`**: A web framework used to run the server API.
* **`google.golang.org/protobuf`**: Handles data serialization.
* **`golang.org/x/sys`**: Provides low-level interaction with your operating system (Windows).

### Where are they stored?

On Windows, Go stores these in a global **Module Cache** so that if you build another Go project using the same libraries, it doesn't have to download them again. By default, they are located here:

`C:\Users\<YourUsername>\go\pkg\mod`

You can verify your specific path by running this command in your terminal:

```powershell
go env GOPATH

```

The files will be inside the `pkg\mod` subfolder of that result.

---

### Can they be cleaned?

Yes, you can safely remove them. Since Go tracks exactly what it needs in the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files in your Ollama folder, deleting the cache won't "break" the project—it just means Go will have to download them again the next time you run or build it.

To clean the module cache, run:

```powershell
go clean -modcache

```

> [!TIP]
> **Warning:** These files are often marked as "read-only" by Go to prevent accidental changes. Using the command above is the best way to delete them, as manual deletion through File Explorer might sometimes trigger permission errors.

### Summary Table

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Why?** | To get the necessary code libraries to run Ollama. |
| **Location** | `%USERPROFILE%\go\pkg\mod` |
| **Safe to delete?** | Yes, but they will re-download next time you run the server. |
| **Command** | `go clean -modcache` |

Would you like me to help you set up a permanent build of Ollama so you don't have to use `go run` every time?
