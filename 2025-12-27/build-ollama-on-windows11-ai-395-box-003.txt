Uninstalling a Go program is much simpler than a standard Windows application because `go install` doesn't create Registry entries or hidden background services. It just places a single `.exe` file in a specific folder.

To "uninstall" Ollama after running `go install .`, you just need to delete that executable.

### 1. Locate the file

The file is stored in your Go binary folder. To find exactly where it is on your machine, run:

```powershell
go env GOBIN

```

* **If it returns a path:** That is exactly where the file is.
* **If it's empty:** It defaults to `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin`. (Usually `C:\Users\YourName\go\bin`).

### 2. Delete it

You can delete it via the Command Prompt or File Explorer:

**Via Command Prompt:**

```powershell
del "$(go env GOPATH)\bin\ollama.exe"

```

*(If `GOPATH` is not set, replace the variable with the manual path: `del %USERPROFILE%\go\bin\ollama.exe`)*

### Is there anything else to clean?

When you build or install Go programs, Go also keeps a "Build Cache" and a "Module Cache" (the downloads you saw earlier). If you want to wipe everything related to the build process to free up disk space:

| Action | Command | What it removes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Clean Build Cache** | `go clean -cache` | Temporary files created during compilation. |
| **Clean Module Cache** | `go clean -modcache` | All those `github.com/...` folders you downloaded. |

### Summary for "Uninstalling"

1. Delete **`ollama.exe`** from your `go/bin` folder.
2. (Optional) Run **`go clean -modcache`** to remove the source code dependencies.
3. (Optional) Delete your **`C:\localrepos\ollama`** folder where you kept the source code.

Once those are gone, Ollama is completely removed from your system. Would you like to know how to verify if any other Go binaries are hiding in your path?
