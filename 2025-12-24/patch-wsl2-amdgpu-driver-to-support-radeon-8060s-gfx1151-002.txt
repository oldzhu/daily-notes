What I changed (gfx1151 / GC 11.5.1 enablement plumbing)

Added missing GC 11.5.x VM hub support by importing upstream files:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/gfxhub_v11_5_0.[ch]
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/mmhub_v3_3.[ch]
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/include/asic_reg/gc/gc_11_5_0_{offset,sh_mask}.h
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/include/asic_reg/mmhub/mmhub_3_3_0_{offset,sh_mask}.h
Wired them into the build: Makefile
Implemented the key upstream bring-up deltas:
gmc_v11_0.c
Select gfxhub_v11_5_0_funcs for IP 11.5.{0,1,2,3}
Select mmhub_v3_3_funcs for MMHUB 3.3.{0,1,2}
Call adev->gfxhub.funcs->init(adev) (upstream does; WSL tree didn’t)
Apply gfx1151 MALL sizing quirk: multiply adev->gmc.mall_size by 2 for IP_VERSION(11, 5, 1)
Enable VM hub mask + VM sizing for 11.5.{0,1,2,3}
amdgpu_discovery.c
Allow soc21_common_ip_block and gmc_v11_0_ip_block for 11.5.{0,1,2,3}
Map 11.5.{0,1,2,3} to AMDGPU_FAMILY_GC_11_5_0
Mark those versions as AMD_IS_APU (matches upstream intent)
Firmware hooks:
gfx_v11_0.c: add gc_11_5_{0..3}_{pfp,me,mec,rlc}.bin MODULE_FIRMWARE + include 11.5.x in gfx_v11_0_gpu_early_init
mes_v11_0.c: add gc_11_5_{0..3}_mes{_2,1}.bin MODULE_FIRMWARE
imu_v11_0.c: add gc_11_5_{0..3}_imu.bin MODULE_FIRMWARE
KFD:
kfd_device.c: treat GC 11.5.x as v11 for event interrupt class selection
SOC21 flags:
soc21.c: added GC 11.5.{0,1,2,3} clock/power gating flag cases (kept PG flags compatible with this tree; upstream uses JPEG_DPG which doesn’t exist here)
Sysfs gates:
amdgpu_pm.c: allow pp_dpm_{vclk,dclk} on GC 11.5.x
Important notes / blockers

I did not add Radeon 8060S PCI IDs yet. Upstream effectively uses the generic CHIP_IP_DISCOVERY catch-all now, so specific IDs aren’t required to start probing; but if your WSL tree doesn’t have those generic entries or you want explicit IDs, we’ll need the actual PCI device ID for 8060S.
I couldn’t run a full build sanity check because make olddefconfig fails: flex isn’t available (flex: Permission denied / not found). You’ll need flex (and typically bison) installed and executable to generate Kconfig outputs.
If you want, tell me whether you can sudo apt-get install flex bison in this environment; if yes, I’ll finish the “Build sanity check AMDGPU” step and fix any compile fallout from the new sources.
