Bilingual docs rollout is complete in build-llm-using-cpp.

Enforced the policy in copilot-instructions.md and added the matching Chinese version copilot-instructions.zh-CN.md.
Ensured every English Markdown doc starts with > [简体中文](X.zh-CN.md) (e.g. attention_indexing_trace.md) and every Chinese doc starts with > English (e.g. attention_indexing_trace.zh-CN.md).
Created .zh-CN.md counterparts for all existing docs, including the architecture + MHA variant docs and notes (see README.zh-CN.md).
Committed as: f2b9250 (“docs: add bilingual EN+zh-CN doc pairs”).

Do you want me to apply the same bilingual-doc pairing rule to the other workspace repo (LLMs-from-scratch) as well, or keep it only for build-llm-using-cpp?
