Created the reference document and linked it from the docs index.

New doc: build-llm-using-cpp/docs/tokenizer_choice_gpt2_bpe_vs_sentencepiece.md

Covers pros/cons of GPT‑2-style BPE vs SentencePiece (BPE/Unigram)
Explains “import existing vocab/merges” vs “learn/train from corpus”
Includes a pragmatic v1 recommendation aligned with this repo’s constraints
Docs index updated: build-llm-using-cpp/docs/README.md

If you want, I can also commit this doc addition as a standalone commit.
