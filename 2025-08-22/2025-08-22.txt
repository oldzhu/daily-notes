Build artifacts can be found in artifacts/bin/native/net10.0-<TargetOS>-<BuildArch>-<BuildType>/

Build artifacts can be found in artifacts/bin/microsoft.netcore.app.runtime.<TargetOS>-<BuildArch>/<BuildType>/runtimes/<TargetOS>-<BuildArch>/lib/net10.0/.

how about Microsoft.Diagnostics.NETCore.Client?

and do we still need Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime.Utilities?
harded coded netcoreapp3_1_path and net6_0_path are also not good. 

```
# Paths for netcoreapp3.1 and net6.0
netcoreapp3_1_path="Release/netcoreapp3.1"
net6_0_path="Release/net6.0"

# Copy *.dll files from Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime and Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime.Utilities
copy_files "$clrmdpath/artifacts/bin/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime/$netcoreapp3_1_path" "$7/root/.dotnet/sos" "*.dll"
copy_files "$clrmdpath/artifacts/bin/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime.Utilities/$netcoreapp3_1_path" "$7/root/.dotnet/sos" "*.dll"

# Copy specific dll files from SymClient
copy_files "$symstorepath/artifacts/bin/SymClient/$netcoreapp3_1_path" "$7/root/.dotnet/sos" "Microsoft.FileFormats.*"
copy_files "$symstorepath/artifacts/bin/SymClient/$netcoreapp3_1_path" "$7/root/.dotnet/sos" "Microsoft.SymbolStore.*"

# Repeat the process for net6.0 if netcoreapp3.1 directories don't exist
copy_files "$clrmdpath/artifacts/bin/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime/$net6_0_path" "$7/root/.dotnet/sos" "*.dll"
copy_files "$clrmdpath/artifacts/bin/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime.Utilities/$net6_0_path" "$7/root/.dotnet/sos" "*.dll"
copy_files "$symstorepath/artifacts/bin/SymClient/$net6_0_path" "$7/root/.dotnet/sos" "Microsoft.FileFormats.*"
copy_files "$symstorepath/artifacts/bin/SymClient/$net6_0_path" "$7/root/.dotnet/sos" "Microsoft.SymbolStore.*"
```
how do we use the runtime built in dotnethello?
