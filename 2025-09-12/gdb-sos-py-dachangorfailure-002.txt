what I understand about how bpmd works in lldb plugin side is that - initialzie the host runtime if it is not initialized, dispacth bpmd to host runtime - then something in host runtime will create bp to coreclr_execute_assembly and bp handler, then bp handler - somehthing in host runtime will try to load dac and create code generation hadler - > once any function jitted - code generation handler called -> code handler will our lldbservice2 to set the breakpoint if it matches with the jitted function ...
in my understanding of the above, most of the work should be done within host runtime, only need to call our implement lldbservice2.execute to set the breapoint once the function jitted, am I right? pls review lldb plugin implementation of bpmd to see If my understanding is correct, if it is, I do think our python code part related with bpmd are doing too much which should not be done by it {such as new object, stop handler} ,am I right? if my undertstaning is correct,we need to simplify our bpmd code and align with lldb pluguin - let sos host runtime to handle most of work for us.

========================

Your mental model is basically correct: in the LLDB plugin the heavy lifting for bpmd lives inside native SOS/host code; the front‑end just dispatches the bpmd command.

Clarifying the LLDB flow (what actually happens):

User runs bpmd (even before CLR loads). The native sos bpmd implementation records (and if already JITTED, resolves) the target method; otherwise it adds a pending entry and asks for CLR (JIT) notifications.
Host (when needed) registers a runtime-loaded callback via ILLDBServices2::SetRuntimeLoadedCallback which plants one native breakpoint on coreclr_execute_assembly with a C++ callback (services.cpp RuntimeLoadedBreakpointCallback).
That breakpoint fires once; the callback loads DAC (now safe), performs any runtime initialization, removes the breakpoint, then continues.
As methods JIT, the CLR sends code generation notifications; native SOS (not the Python/LLDB front-end) matches them against its pending bpmd list and (through debugger services) sets the real native breakpoints at method entry.
Later JITs keep flowing; bpmd pending entries resolve natively; front-end Python/LLDB layer does nothing extra.
Where your current GDB Python layer is doing “too much” compared to LLDB:

Manually planting / managing a pending coreclr_execute_assembly breakpoint (duplicate of native host responsibility).
Maintaining a Python _bpmd_pending list and flushing it after a libcoreclr load hook (should be native SOS’s pending list).
Hooking new-objfile / stop events and issuing auto-continues (the LLDB plugin only auto-continues after the one runtime-loaded breakpoint, not on general stops or exceptions).
Installing exception callback logic then unconditional continue (not mirroring LLDB’s narrower continue semantics).
Extra tracing/new object logic around bpmd that belongs in native notifications.
So yes: Python layer is overreaching; we can slim it to LLDB parity.

Recommended simplification plan:

Remove Python _bpmd_pending, defer hook, and manual coreclr_execute_assembly breakpoint planting in sos.py / services.py.
Ensure native gdb bridge (C++ side) exposes/implements a SetRuntimeLoadedCallback equivalent (mirroring LLDB’s SetRuntimeLoadedCallback + breakpoint + auto-continue once).
On first bpmd command in Python: just ensure (a) native host initialized (InitManagedHosting if not yet), then (b) DispatchManagedCommand("bpmd", args). No extra breakpoint logic.
Drop Python stop/exception auto-continue tied to bpmd; only allow native runtime-loaded callback to continue; let exceptions stop unless user explicitly resumes.
Keep (optional) lightweight tracing (just logging the sos bpmd dispatch + later actual method breakpoint hit) but sourced from native services if possible.
Add regression test: issue bpmd before run, start target, verify:
coreclr_execute_assembly single breakpoint is created and removed (native).
Method breakpoint is inserted after JIT and triggers a stop at managed method entry.
Remove now-obsolete environment flags / code paths referencing the Python pending queue.
Potential additions on native side (if missing in gdb bridge):

Implement runtime-loaded breakpoint logic analogous to lines ~2140–2150 of lldb services.cpp.
Wire a code-gen notification path (should already exist via SOS pending breakpoint infra) into GDB debugger services to set native breakpoints.
Risk / considerations:

Must confirm native SOS already maintains pending list for bpmd under GDB scenario; if the gdb bridge doesn’t yet deliver the needed callbacks (method load/code-gen), we need to add them there rather than re-implement in Python.
Ensure we don’t reintroduce early DAC load race: keep the runtime-loaded breakpoint gating DAC load like LLDB.
If you want, I can draft the concrete Python cleanup and a stub C++ addition outline next—just say the word. Let me know if you’d like to proceed with code changes.

Preparing summary of changes and next native alignment steps. Implemented Python-side simplification: removed bpmd pending queue, runtime entry breakpoint planting, defer hooks, auto-continue logic, and one-shot temporary breakpoint tricks. services.py no longer forces an immediate continue or triggers exception callback unconditionally; runtime-loaded breakpoint now stops (user control). Byte-compilation passed (no syntax errors).

Next native alignment steps:

Ensure native gdb bridge adds a SetRuntimeLoadedCallback path mirroring LLDB (single coreclr_execute_assembly breakpoint, auto-continue only if callback returns success).
Confirm code-gen / JIT notification pathway in native bridge correctly causes SOS to resolve pending bpmd breakpoints (should already exist if using shared SOS code).
Add minimal tracing in native bridge (optional) to log: runtime-loaded callback fired, method breakpoint inserted, breakpoint hit.
Remove any now-dead Python attributes (e.g., _bpmd_pending references elsewhere) after a runtime smoke test.
Add/update a test scenario: run dotnet target, issue bpmd before run, verify stop at managed method (adapt existing tests/gdb scenarios).
Let me know when you’re ready to proceed with native bridge adjustments or want a commit message draft.
