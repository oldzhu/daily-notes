I generated the bilingual daily report for the latest 5 commits per area from the upstream Linux repo (current branch). Review here:

English: docs/2026-02-09-daily-report.md
简体中文: docs/2026-02-09-daily-report.zh-CN.md
Notes:

The report is path-based and includes merge commits where they touch the area paths (e.g., scheduler and DRM merges). If you want to exclude merges or use a different mapping, tell me and I’ll regenerate.
