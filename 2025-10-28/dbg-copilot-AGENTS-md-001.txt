You’re right—AGENTS.md in many repos is a guidance doc for AI agents and automation, not a product feature guide. I’ll roll back the previous AGENTS.md to align with that pattern, update the README link text, and summarize what AGENTS.md typically contains.

what AGENTS.md is used for
Purpose: A concise handbook for AI agents and automated tools contributing to the repo.
Audience: Bots and humans using automated workflows (including LLM-based agents) to propose code changes.
Typical contents:
Repository overview and structure
Build and test commands (green-before-done expectations)
Coding standards and style
Safe-change principles: small, focused diffs; avoid sweeping refactors
How to run linters/tests and validate changes
Where to edit (key files) and what not to touch
PR etiquette, commit messages, and documentation rules
Troubleshooting tips and common pitfalls
This aligns with the AGENTS.md in:

radareorg/radare2: “Agentic Coding Guidelines” with coding rules, quick actions, and test/build steps
dotnet/diagnostics: “Agent Guidelines” covering coding standards, build/test, project structure, dependencies, PR workflow
actions taken
Replaced the product-focused AGENTS.md with agent-contribution guidelines tailored to this repo, modeled after the radare2 and .NET Diagnostics patterns. It includes:
Repo overview and key locations
Build/test steps (make build, make install-wheel, pytest -q)
Coding standards (PEP 8, small diffs, avoid heavy deps)
Change process and PR guidance
Quick “actions” section (compile/package, run tests, ad-hoc lint)
Project structure hints (orchestrator, providers, REPLs, prompts)
Troubleshooting tips and notes for agentic tools
Updated README’s reference to AGENTS.md so it correctly points to “contribution guidelines for automated agents,” not product agent-mode behavior.
Verified tests: PASS.
files changed
AGENTS.md — replaced with “Agent Guidelines for Debugger Copilot Repository”
README.md — updated link text to reflect the proper AGENTS.md purpose
what’s next
If you’d like, I can add a short “Docs” or “Contributing for agents” section in README’s top-level navigation to surface AGENTS.md more prominently.
I can also add a brief lint step (e.g., ruff/flake8) if you want stricter style enforcement; right now we keep it light and rely on py_compile/tests.
If you want me to tailor AGENTS.md further (e.g., add CI checklist, commit template, or a “do/don’t” matrix), tell me the policies you prefer and I’ll extend it.
