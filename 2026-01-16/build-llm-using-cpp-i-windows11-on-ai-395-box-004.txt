The training of reasoning models like **OpenAI o1** and **DeepSeek R1** marks a massive shift in how we build AI.

Traditional GPT training is about **imitation** (predicting the next word), while the new "Reasoning" training is about **exploration** (trial and error to find the right logic).

### 1. The Core Innovation: Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Unlike standard LLMs that are mostly "Supervised" (learning from human-written answers), reasoning models are trained using **large-scale Reinforcement Learning**.

* **The Reward System:** In traditional training, a model is "correct" if it matches a human's words. In reasoning models, the model is rewarded based on **The Final Answer**.
* If the model is asked a math problem, it can "think" however it wants. If the final answer is `42`, it gets a reward. If it's `41`, it gets penalized.


* **The "Aha Moment":** Because the reward is on the answer, not the process, the model starts to "invent" ways to get there. It learns that if it stops, re-reads the question, or checks its own work, it is more likely to get the reward.

### 2. New Technique: GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)

DeepSeek introduced a specific new RL algorithm called **GRPO** to replace the old standard, PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization).

* **The Old Way (PPO):** Required a second "Critic" model to watch the first model and judge its work. This uses a lot of computer memory.
* **The New Way (GRPO):** The model generates a **group** of different "thoughts" and "answers" for the same question at once.
* It compares the answers within that group.
* It rewards the ones that were better than the group average.
* **Result:** It’s much more efficient and allows the model to learn complex reasoning on a "budget."

### 3. The "Cold Start" vs. "Pure RL"

There are two distinct ways researchers are now starting the training:

| Method | **Pure RL (R1-Zero)** | **Cold Start (R1 / o1)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Beginning** | Model starts with zero reasoning examples. | Model is given a few thousand "Golden Examples" of humans thinking step-by-step. |
| **Process** | Total trial and error. | Learn the *format* of thinking first, then explore via RL. |
| **Outcome** | Amazing reasoning, but messy output (mixes languages, hard to read). | High reasoning AND human-friendly, readable logic. |

### 4. New Paper Concepts: "Inference-Time Scaling"

A key concept popularized by the **OpenAI o1** report and the **DeepSeek R1** paper is the **"Scaling Law of Inference."**

* **Traditional Scaling:** To make a model smarter, you give it more data during **training**.
* **New Scaling:** To make a model smarter, you give it more **time/tokens to think** during **inference** (the moment you ask the question).
* Researchers found that performance keeps going up the longer you let the model "search" for the right reasoning path.

### 5. Summary of New Training Pipeline

Modern reasoning models usually follow this 4-step "virtuous cycle":

1. **Cold Start:** Fine-tune on a tiny bit of high-quality "thinking" data.
2. **Reasoning RL:** Massive trial-and-error on math and code where the answer is easily verifiable.
3. **Rejection Sampling:** The model looks at its own "best" reasoning paths and uses those as new training data for the next version.
4. **Final Alignment:** Making sure the "thinking" remains safe and helpful for humans.

**Would you like me to explain how "Rejection Sampling" allows the model to basically become its own teacher?**
