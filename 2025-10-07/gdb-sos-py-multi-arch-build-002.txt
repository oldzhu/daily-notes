what u mean "switch the toolset dirs to live under src/diagnostics and src/runtime (e.g., src/diagnostics/.dotnet-amd64 and .dotnet-arm64), I can update the compose env to match.", pls explain what u will do but do not aply the code change before I understand and agree.

===========

Good question—here’s exactly what I meant by “switch the toolset dirs to live under src/diagnostics and src/runtime,” plus the implications, without changing any code yet.

Two viable layouts
Option A (what we set up now): one per-arch toolset at workspace root

x64: /workspaces/gdbsos/.dotnet-amd64
arm64: /workspaces/gdbsos/.dotnet-arm64
Pros: simple, no further changes needed; both submodules reuse the same per-arch toolset.
Cons: diagnostics and runtime share the same SDK location; if they need different SDKs simultaneously, this can clash.
Option B (what I proposed): per-submodule, per-arch toolsets

Diagnostics:
x64: /workspaces/gdbsos/src/diagnostics/.dotnet-amd64
arm64: /workspaces/gdbsos/src/diagnostics/.dotnet-arm64
Runtime:
x64: /workspaces/gdbsos/src/runtime/.dotnet-amd64
arm64: /workspaces/gdbsos/src/runtime/.dotnet-arm64
Pros: complete isolation; diagnostics and runtime can pin different SDKs without stepping on each other.
Cons: slightly more complexity and disk use; requires a small tweak to build.sh so each submodule uses its own path.
How Option B would work (concrete plan, no changes yet)
Choose install dirs per submodule and arch as listed above.

Adjust environment usage (what the build scripts look for)

Both diagnostics and runtime use Arcade’s tooling logic (eng/common/tools.sh) which honors:
DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR: where to install/use the SDK
DOTNET_ROOT: often set equal to DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR
DOTNET_MULTILEVEL_LOOKUP=0: keeps builds hermetic
PATH: prepend

 IRand{DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR}/tools for convenience
Minimal change in build.sh to set the right directory before each submodule build
Before running diagnostics build:
export DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR=/workspaces/gdbsos/src/diagnostics/.dotnet-${ARCH}
export DOTNET_ROOT=$DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR
export PATH="$DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR:$DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR/tools:$PATH"
Then invoke build.sh …
Before running runtime build:
Re-export DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR=/workspaces/gdbsos/src/runtime/.dotnet-${ARCH}
export DOTNET_ROOT=$DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR
export PATH="$DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR:$DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR/tools:$PATH"
Then invoke build.sh …
Compose environment for dev containers
We can either:
Keep DOTNET_* unset in compose so build.sh owns the choice per submodule (simplest/most explicit), or
Set a “default” per arch (e.g., point to diagnostics) knowing build.sh will override to runtime before calling runtime’s build.
For clarity, I’d prefer the first: let build.sh set DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR/ROOT just-in-time per submodule.
Compatibility
If DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR isn’t set, Arcade defaults to repoRoot/.dotnet (which is what caused the original conflict).
With Option B, there’s no ambiguity—each submodule installs to its own arch-specific folder.
TL;DR recommendations
If you don’t need different SDKs per submodule right now, Option A (per-arch at workspace root) is already enough and simpler.
If you want the most robust isolation (and the ability to run both submodules concurrently with different SDKs), go with Option B:
I’ll tweak build.sh to export DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR/ROOT per submodule call as above.
I’ll leave DOTNET_* unset in compose so build.sh is the single source of truth.
If you choose Option B, say the word and I’ll implement exactly those build.sh exports (no other behavior changes), and keep compose env clean so there’s no accidental override.
