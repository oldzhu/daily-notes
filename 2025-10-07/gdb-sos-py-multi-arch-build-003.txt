I choose Option B and one more question is that after all these chanes, do I need to rebuild the containers?

===========
Got it—Option B it is. Here’s what I’ll change (when you say go), and whether a container rebuild is needed.

What I’ll change (no edits yet)
Update build.sh to set per-submodule, per-arch toolsets just-in-time:

Before calling diagnostics build:
export DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR=/workspaces/gdbsos/src/diagnostics/.dotnet-${ARCH}
export DOTNET_ROOT=$DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR
export DOTNET_MULTILEVEL_LOOKUP=0
export PATH="$DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR:$DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR/tools:$PATH"
Before calling runtime build:
Same pattern, but with /workspaces/gdbsos/src/runtime/.dotnet-${ARCH}
Stop setting DOTNET_* in the devcontainer compose services:

Rely on build.sh to choose the correct per-submodule path.
This avoids any accidental cross-arch bleed from container-level env.
Optional cleanup step (one-time):

Remove or relocate any old .dotnet folder(s) at:
/workspaces/gdbsos/.dotnet-*
.dotnet
.dotnet
This prevents mixing previously downloaded SDKs with the new layout.
Do you need to rebuild the containers?
If we only change build.sh:

No container rebuild is needed. The script exports env vars for the subprocesses it runs; your current containers are fine.
If we also change devcontainer compose (removing DOTNET_* env at the service level):

You’ll need to Reopen/Rebuild the container to pick up the new compose env:
VS Code: Dev Containers → Rebuild and Reopen in Container
This recreates the container with updated environment, but does not rebuild the image unless the Dockerfile changed.
The QEMU/binfmt service change you already have will keep working; no extra step needed unless you also modify Dockerfile or compose further.

Quick sanity after we switch
In amd64 container:
echo $DOTNET_ROOT should be empty (container-level), and build.sh will export per-submodule values on demand.
After running the diagnostics build, you should see a populated /workspaces/gdbsos/src/diagnostics/.dotnet-x64.
In arm64 container:
Similarly, diagnostics will populate /workspaces/gdbsos/src/diagnostics/.dotnet-arm64, and runtime will use its own /src/runtime/.dotnet-arm64, so both containers can build concurrently without conflicts.
If this looks good, I’ll implement the build.sh exports and remove the compose-level DOTNET_* env so the script is the single source of truth.
