Yes — lowering concurrency can absolutely reduce the hit rate for a timing-dependent “hung task” like this.

Two key knobs affect probability a lot:

SMP (vCPUs): with SMP=1 you remove a bunch of interleavings/lock contention that often make hangs easier to trigger.
EXECPROG_PROCS + EXECPROG_THREADED: fewer parallel syscalls → fewer races → lower chance to hit the exact bad window.
That said, we lowered concurrency because higher settings were repeatedly dying early (boot-time KASAN/panic). So it’s a tradeoff: stability vs. reproduction speed.

Practical approach: ramp concurrency up gradually until it starts crashing again.

Stop the current run:
cd /home/oldzhu/mylinux/kernel_radar && [run_issue3_manual.sh](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) --stop --clean
Try a “moderate” setting first (often a good compromise):
SMP=2 EXECPROG_PROCS=2 EXECPROG_THREADED=1 EXECPROG_REPEAT=0 tools/run_issue3_manual.sh
If stable for ~10–20 minutes, bump EXECPROG_PROCS:
SMP=2 EXECPROG_PROCS=4 EXECPROG_THREADED=1 EXECPROG_REPEAT=0 tools/run_issue3_manual.sh
If it starts boot-panicking again, back off one notch (e.g. SMP=1 but EXECPROG_PROCS=2).
Monitoring stays the same:

INTERVAL=1 TAIL_N=20 tools/monitor_issue3_watch.sh repro/a9528028ab4ca83e8bac
If you tell me whether the original syzbot repro used something like -procs=6 and SMP=2, I can help pick the next “closest-but-stable” setting.
