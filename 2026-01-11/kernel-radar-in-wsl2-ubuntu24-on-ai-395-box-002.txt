Added a transparent helper script: tools/run_issue3_manual.sh
Restarts QEMU (daemon by default) in the bundle dir
Waits for SSH with hard timeouts (won’t hang)
scp’s syz-execprog, syz-executor, and repro.syz into /root/repro
Starts syz-execprog in the background and logs a staging transcript into the bundle (.tmp_stage_run.YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS.txt)
Starts a serial-log watcher (optional) writing to watch_patterns.log (in the bundle, which is gitignored)
Updated the manual runbook doc to reference it: docs/repro-syzbot-issue3-vhost-worker-killed.md
Committed + pushed to origin/main: f73d240 tools/docs: add helper script for issue #3 manual repro
How to run it (from repo root):

tools/run_issue3_manual.sh
Common overrides:

SYZ_BIN=$HOME/mylinux/syzkaller/bin/linux_amd64 tools/run_issue3_manual.sh
MEM=4096 SMP=4 tools/run_issue3_manual.sh
HOSTFWD_PORT=10023 tools/run_issue3_manual.sh
If you want, next I can add a --stop mode to the script to kill QEMU + watcher cleanly.

Updated the helper script to support clean lifecycle control:
Added --stop to kill QEMU (from qemu.pid) and the watcher (from watcher.pid)
Added --status to print whether QEMU/watcher are running + log sizes
Added --clean (with --stop) to also remove the pidfiles
Updated the doc snippet in docs/repro-syzbot-issue3-vhost-worker-killed.md to mention --stop/--status.
Committed + pushed to origin/main: df4141a tools/docs: add stop/status to issue #3 repro helper
Commands you can use now (from repo root):

tools/run_issue3_manual.sh
tools/run_issue3_manual.sh --status
tools/run_issue3_manual.sh --stop (or --stop --clean)
