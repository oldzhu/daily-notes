dbgcopilot is already installed with the same version as the provided wheel. Use --force-reinstall to force an installation of the wheel.
WARNING: There was an error checking the latest version of pip.
=====

The wheel is already installed, so pip skipped it. To reinstall the fresh build, do one of:

pip install --force-reinstall dist/dbgcopilot-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
or pip uninstall -y dbgcopilot && pip install dist/dbgcopilot-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
The pip version-check warning is benign and usually due to network/proxy restrictions; you can ignore it.
