great now I would like to test it to debug the progtram examples/crash/rust/crash/src/main.rs, do I need to build it 1st? what tool I need to install in order to build the rust program? rustc?
===========
Yes—you’ll want a compiled binary before attaching the debugger.

Install the Rust toolchain (includes rustc, cargo, rust-std). The recommended route is rustup:
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
Restart your shell or source ~/.cargo/env.
Pick the default stable toolchain when prompted.
Verify with cargo --version and rustc --version.
Build the sample binary:
cargo build --manifest-path examples/crash/rust/Cargo.toml
The resulting executable will be at examples/crash/rust/target/debug/crash.
Once the build succeeds, point the debugger at that binary (e.g. /use lldb-rust → /exec file examples/crash/rust/target/debug/crash) and you’re ready to debug.

Rust Toolchain Ready

Updated Dockerfile to install Rust via rustup (stable minimal profile) and expose cargo on PATH, plus added rustfmt/clippy.
Ensured curl is available during build so the installer works.
Git commit: Install Rust toolchain in devcontainer

Tests not run here—consider rebuilding the devcontainer or running rustc --version afterward to verify.

=======

Rust is installed now. Great!

To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
This would reload your PATH environment variable to include
Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).

To configure your current shell, you need to source
the corresponding env file under $HOME/.cargo.

This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"            # For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env.fish"  # For fish
source $"($nu.home-path)/.cargo/env.nu"  # For nushell
