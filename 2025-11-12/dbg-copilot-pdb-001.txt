I researched more on debugpy and pdb(python debugger), now I think I prefer pdb but debugpy, as our project backbone is CLI console based and debugpy is for IDE and has additional inter-process cost, so pls remove the implementation for debugpy from our project and add the one for pdb(python debugger)
======
Python Backend Swapped

Replaced the debugpy-based backend with a new python_pdb backend that drives python -m pdb through pexpect; wired it into the session manager, REPL, and web UI labels.
Removed the old python_debugpy module and the debugpy project dependency; updated README and example docs to point users at the pdb flow.
Adjusted the smoke test to import the new backend and confirmed the REPL help text now advertises “Python (pdb backend)”.
Tests

pytest -q
Next Steps

Try /use python in dbgcopilot, then /exec file examples/crash/python/crash.py followed by /exec run to exercise the pdb backend end-to-end.
Review the new backend file (python_pdb.py) for any extra pdb commands you’d like exposed.
When satisfied, commit with something like git add -A && git commit -m "Replace debugpy backend with pdb backend".
