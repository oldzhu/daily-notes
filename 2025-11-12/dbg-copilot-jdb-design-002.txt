for questions

better to support both - a precompiled .class/.jar (aligning with jdb MainClass) and compile on demand.
I would like to support both too - multi-module support and a single -classpath argument, but it is fine to start as a single -classpath argument initially for demo.
my questions. we need to add testing java proj files to examples/crash/java and examples/hang/java, in order to build the testing proj and debug, what we need to install in our dev coniatiner?
========
Install a full JDK in the container so we get javac, java, and jdb. Ubuntu 24.04 has openjdk-21-jdk (current LTS) which is a good default; Java 17 also works if we prefer the previous LTS. Either package brings everything needed for running and debugging.
For compiling the example projects we can rely on plain javac plus jar, both included with the JDK. This covers single-class demos and simple multi-file setups without extra tooling.
If we anticipate multi-module builds or want a standard build pipeline, add maven (and/or gradle) to the devcontainer. Maven is lightweight enough to include now; Gradle can be added later if required.
With the JDK (and optionally Maven) in place we can create examples/crash/java and examples/hang/java, compile via javac, and drive jdb directly inside the container.
