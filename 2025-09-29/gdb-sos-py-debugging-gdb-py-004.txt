Why/what/outcome: I'll inspect gdbtestutils.py to implement two-phase functions (prepare_and_prime/resume_after_continue) and lightweight bpmd-only and wait-only helpers. Expected outcome: Identify where to add functions without breaking existing imports.

Why/what/outcome: I’ll update the test harness to run a single GDB session with two-phase execution: prepare_phase (sets bpmd), then CLI 'continue' (lets GDB event loop run), then verify_phase (runs scenario assertions without blocking). Expected outcome: test_gdbsos.py builds a single -batch command accordingly.

Completed (12/12) *Make test flow two-phase (async)*

You’re right—the root cause is our Python loop holding GDB’s main thread, so SOS’s exception-callback work can’t run until we interrupt. I’ve implemented an asynchronous two-phase test flow so we don’t block the event loop while waiting for the bpmd stop.

What I changed
- Reverted continues to async in the plugin but kept exception auto-continue suppressed (unchanged from your last run).
- Updated the test harness to run a single GDB session with two explicit phases:
  1) prepare_phase: set up, hit coreclr entry, prime bpmd, then return control to GDB immediately.
  2) CLI continue: issued as a normal GDB command, not from Python, so GDB’s event loop can process SOS callbacks.
  3) verify_phase: run scenario assertions with a skip flag that avoids re-issuing bpmd/continue and simply asserts we’re stopped.
- Added two-phase helpers in gdbtestutils.py:
  - `prepare_phase(host, assembly, scenario_module)`
  - `verify_phase(scenario_module)`
  - Internally, `bpmd_and_continue` now supports a skip-mode used by `verify_phase` to just assert we’re stopped without entering a polling loop that blocks.

Files changed
- services.py and artifacts:
  - `_schedule_safe_continue` now uses `gdb.post_event(_do_continue)` again, with trace: “[continue] _schedule_safe_continue: invoking 'continue' (async posted)”.
  - Exception auto-continue remains suppressed.
- test_gdbsos.py:
  - Now runs a single GDB with:
    - python test.prepare_phase(...)
    - continue
    - python test.verify_phase(...)
  - Keeps the original summary/flags behavior.
- gdbtestutils.py:
  - Added `prepare_phase`, `verify_phase`, and an internal skip flag for `bpmd_and_continue`.
  - Existing `run()` left intact for compatibility with other scenarios.

How it avoids the hang
- We no longer sit in a Python polling loop after continue. The actual continue runs as a CLI command, which gives GDB a chance to process SOS’s posted continues and the exception callback’s work (JIT, bind `bpmd`, hit break).
- Verification runs only after continue returns control to the CLI, so `gdb.newest_frame()` should succeed without “Selected thread is running.”

Try it
- Run the same harness as before (t_cmd_pe). It now logs to a single `.log` per scenario since we merged phases back into one session.
- If you still see issues, paste the t_cmd_pe.log and I’ll adjust quickly.

Quality gates
- Syntax/type checks: Python edits are straightforward; no import/basename errors introduced; existing runner contract preserved.
- Requirements coverage:
  - Async control back to GDB: Done via CLI continue.
  - Keep exception auto-continue disabled: Still disabled.
  - Compare behavior with prior async/sync plugin continue: Now isolated from Python wait-loop interference.

If this flow works for t_cmd_pe, I can apply the same pattern to other scenarios or generalize it behind a harness flag.

Made changes.
