we are currently in wsl2-linux-kernel source tree which is the latest branch linux-msft-wsl-6.6.y. If u review the driver code for amd gpu which is under drivers/gpu/drm/amd, u will see it hasn't contain the implementation to support the adm radeon 8060s (gfx1151). The support to 8060s(gfx1151) support has already been contained in the mainline linux kernel. You can review the code at https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/gpu/drm/amd/ to learn about that. Now I want to add the support to gfx1151 in wsl2 branch linux-msft-wsl-6.6.y. Please review the sources at the two branches for amd drivers and plan, design,schedule and implement.
