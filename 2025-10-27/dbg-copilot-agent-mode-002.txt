for agent mode, in agent mode prompts I think we'd better to ask llm to not asking conirmatrion and generate the <cmd>..<cmd> directly so that the whole flow can be auto completed without user intervantion.
===========

Great call—I've made agent mode explicitly “no confirmation, emit <cmd> directly,” and removed conflicting guidance when agent mode is on.

Here’s what I changed to ensure full automation in agent mode:

Orchestrator prompt building updated

In AgentOrchestrator.ask():
If SessionState.mode == 'auto', the prompt now uses agent_mode_preamble and filters out rules that mention proposals or confirmations. We don’t include the confirmation-based assistant_cmd_tag_instructions in agent mode. This instructs the LLM to emit <cmd> directly.
In interactive mode, the original confirmation flow remains unchanged.
In the agent auto-continue loop (_execute_and_maybe_auto()):
Also switched to the agent preamble and filtered rules to avoid any confirmation prompts during iteration.
No confirmation step is requested at any point; the LLM is told to output <cmd> directly. Non-<cmd> output is treated as the final report and ends the loop.
Agent mode scaffolding already in place

/agent on|off exists in:
standalone.py
repl.py
repl.py
/config in all REPLs now shows the current mode so you can verify the toggle.
Prompts updated to align with your wording preference

“Prefer the suitable and reasonable command(s) for the situation.” replaces “low-risk” across first-party configs:
defaults.py (rules)
tool_instructions.md
suggest_commands.md
prompts.json
Verification

Syntax/lint: PASS on updated files.
Tests: Skipped per your instruction.
Would you like me to add a short README section documenting agent mode behavior and the /agent toggle, then commit this batch?
