Plan

Update standalone REPL help and remove handlers for /summary and /goal.
Update GDB and LLDB plugin REPLs to remove help entries and handlers.
Update README examples and command list to drop those commands.
Run tests.
Actions taken

Standalone REPL: removed /summary and /goal from help and command handling in src/dbgcopilot/repl/standalone.py.
GDB plugin REPLs:
src/dbgcopilot/plugins/gdb/repl.py: removed /summary and /goal help and handlers.
repl.py (dev-time helper): removed /summary and /goal help and handlers.
LLDB plugin REPL: removed /summary and /goal help and handlers in src/dbgcopilot/plugins/lldb/repl.py.
README: removed /summary and /goal from the slash-command list and example flows.
Verification

Lint/type: PASS (no new errors).
Tests: pytest -q → . [100%] PASS.
What’s next

If you want, I can add a brief “How to ask for a goal/summary” note in README to guide users to ask the LLM directly, but I left docs minimal per your request.
Ready to commit on your signal; or I can commit now if you’d like me to handle it.
