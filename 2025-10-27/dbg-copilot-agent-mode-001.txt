Besides the small improvement opportunities, I would like the below two changes:

as it is designed to always ask approval before execute the debugger command, pls change prefer low-risk command to prefer the suitable and reasonable command.
for orchestrtor, modify the below behavior
from
....
If it finds <cmd>…</cmd> in the LLM’s reply, it executes that command via the current debugger backend, captures output, stores it, then sends a follow-up prompt (same preamble + rules) asking the LLM to “decide the next step per the rules” using that fresh output.
....
to
...
If it finds <cmd>…</cmd> in the LLM’s reply, it executes that command via the current debugger backend, captures output, stores it, then by default wait for user typing next. only sends a follow-up prompt (same preamble + rules) asking the LLM to “decide the next step per the rules until find solution or root cause identified” using that fresh output + context when agent mode is on.
...
we can turn on agent mode through / command,basically what I am thinking agent mode is you asking copilot+llm to do auto analysis and give the final report of root cause and solution (why crash, wht hang, why leak) utomatically, in agent mode, no user interaction and all is auto done. we may need create special prompts for agent mode.
==========

Thanks—I'll keep iterating now by wiring in agent mode and updating the “low‑risk” phrasing across prompts, plus the orchestrator’s follow-up behavior.

Actions taken
Phrasing update

Replaced “Prefer low-risk …” with “Prefer the suitable and reasonable command(s) for the situation.” in:
defaults.py (rules)
tool_instructions.md
suggest_commands.md
prompts.json (so overrides align with defaults)
Orchestrator behavior

Added agent mode and changed the default execution flow:
In orchestrator.py, when a reply includes <cmd>…</cmd>:
Default (interactive): execute once and return output; no automatic follow-up.
Agent mode: execute and auto-continue until a final report or step limit.
Implemented new helper _execute_and_maybe_auto that:
Executes the command, records state
If mode == auto, loops up to max_auto_steps:
Asks the LLM with agent preamble to decide the next step
Executes returned <cmd> or treats non-<cmd> as the final report
Returns concatenated transcript pieces
Updated ask() docstring to reflect the interactive default and agent mode behavior.
Added agent-mode prompt scaffolding to defaults.py:
agent_mode_preamble clarifying no confirmation and final report stop condition
agent_followup_instruction
max_auto_steps default = 12
REPL support for agent mode

Standalone REPL: standalone.py
Added /agent on|off
Show current mode in /config
Help updated to include the new command
GDB REPL: repl.py
Added /agent on|off
Show current mode in /config
Help updated
LLDB REPL: repl.py
Added /agent on|off
Show current mode in /config
Help updated
Notes
Behavior change summary:

Before: After executing a <cmd>, we always asked the LLM for one “next step” follow-up automatically.
Now:
Interactive (default): We execute the confirmed <cmd> and then wait for the user.
Agent mode: We execute and then automatically iterate with the LLM until we have a final report or hit the step cap.
Confirmation flow remains intact:

The LLM still proposes and asks for user confirmation before emitting <cmd> in interactive mode. We don’t parse yes/no locally.
Safety and termination conditions for agent mode:

The agent will stop when:
The LLM returns a non-<cmd> response (treated as the final report), or
max_auto_steps is reached.
Residual copies of the “low-risk” phrase may still exist in egg-info or site-packages paths, which are not first-party sources. All first-party prompt sources that affect runtime behavior have been updated.

What’s next
Optional: Add a short README section describing agent mode and the /agent on|off toggle. I can do this next if you want.
Completion summary

Build/lint: PASS for edited Python files (no syntax errors reported).
Tests: Skipped per your request. If you want, I can run a quick smoke test later.
Want me to document agent mode in README and then commit this set of changes?
