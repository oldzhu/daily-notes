back to our clru issue, I run it with pagination off and it enter into endless with garbage characters displayed in terminal and finally the container is restarted, CTRL+c also cant stop the loop.


========================

I’m going to stop the clru “endless loop” by fixing our ILLDBServices.Disassemble so it always makes forward progress and can’t spin on the same address.

Checklist

Fix infinite loop: ensure Disassemble advances endOffset and returns sensible status
Correct ABI signature for Disassemble buffer to avoid memory misuse
Null-terminate and bounds-check output text
Keep the change minimal and safe
Actions taken

Corrected ABI for Disassemble to match diagnostics’ IDL (buffer is void*, not char*):
Updated ILLDBServicesVtbl.Disassemble signature in abi.py to use ctypes.c_void_p.
Updated vtable creation in services.py to match.
Implemented a safe Disassemble in GdbServices:
lldb_disassemble now tries a one-instruction disassembly via gdb.execute("x/1i <addr>", to_string=True).
Writes the decoded text into the provided buffer, NUL-terminated, respecting bufferSize.
Sets disSize to bytes written.
Always advances endOffset by at least 1 byte even if text isn’t produced, guaranteeing forward progress.
Returns S_OK (0) when something was written, S_FALSE (1) otherwise, avoiding callers looping on the same address.
This directly addresses the behavior where our previous stub returned S_FALSE and left endOffset unchanged, which can cause a tight, uninterruptible loop with garbage output and eventual terminal meltdown.
Try it

Since this is Python-only, you can just re-source the script in GDB:
From the directory where you source sos.py (diagnostics/artifacts/bin/current), run in GDB:
source sos.py
Then run your clru scenario again with pagination off.
If you use our deploy flow, copy updated Python files next to libsos.so as usual, then source again.
Notes

Ctrl+C couldn’t stop the loop before because the caller was stuck requesting the same disassembly repeatedly; advancing endOffset breaks that cycle.
If disassembly isn’t possible at some addresses, it will still progress byte-by-byte and terminate based on the SOS command’s count/limit.
Quality gates

Build/lint: Python files updated; no syntax/type errors detected in the workspace for the edited files.
Runtime: Behavior changes are localized to the ILLDBServices.Disassemble callback used by clru/u.
Requirements coverage

clru infinite loop: Done (Disassemble now advances and returns stable results)
Avoid garbage/unbounded printing: Done (bounded writes, NUL-terminated, forward progress)
If clru still floods the terminal due to sheer volume, we can add a small optional cap (e.g., max N instructions per call) or temporarily disable GDB pagination during SOS calls and restore it afterward, but let’s see if this fix resolves your issue first.


yes the endloop fixed but the output does not make sense to me at least it is not meaninful and helpful as clru in windbg/cdb(not check in lldb could compare and check later). I know it could be complex to fix so we can delay that kind of work to later stage
