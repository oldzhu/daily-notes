another issue need to note is the order to run SOS managed command which could impact the running result.
for example run dso before the target host runtime and would get the error which it is expected as the target runtime
is still not loded. the issue is that after target runtime loaded, if u run dso again in the same session you will always get the error unless u restart the debugging session. Could you pls check how lldb plugin handle this scneario. I 
guess it will check if the target runtime is loaded or not, if it is not loaded in the target process, then lldb plugin
will not initialize the SOS host runtime also otherwise it will get the same behavoir as us, if run managed command 
before the target runtime, the error will persists even after the target runtime was loaded. Could we do the same as lldb plugin to avoid that wired behavior.
