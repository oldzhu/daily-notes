I think the new change won'g work, pls check how lldb plug in works in diagnostic submodule services.cpp, it will create bp on coreclr_execute_assembly and then set this bp call back to runtimeloadedbpcallback - >when the bp hit, the runtimeloadedbpcllabck will call callback whcih is HandleRuntimeLoadedNotification set by strike.cpp -> HandleRuntimeLoadedNotification will enable module load/unload call backs which will cause runtime to raise c++ exception for module load/unload and also call our SetExceptionCallback to HandleExceptionNOtification which later can handle the rraised c++ exception(includeing module load/unload and clrn jitted exception)
let us align with lldb services.cpp setruntimeloadedcallback and setexceptioncallback to cooperate with sos strike.cpp
=============

I'll update the GDB plugin to align with the LLDB flow: install a persistent, silent C++ throw catchpoint in lldb_set_exception_callback to invoke the exception callback, and complete the runtime-loaded breakpoint to invoke the callback once when coreclr_execute_assembly is hit.

Thanks for the pointer to the LLDB flow—I'll align the GDB plugin to match that contract so it cooperates cleanly with sos/strike.cpp. I’ve updated the canonical source to do exactly what services.cpp does:

SetRuntimeLoadedCallback: create a pending, silent breakpoint on coreclr_execute_assembly, and when it’s hit call the runtime-loaded callback once and auto-continue.
SetExceptionCallback: install a persistent, silent C++ throw catchpoint that invokes the exception callback (only after runtime-loaded has fired). This lets strike.cpp’s HandleRuntimeLoadedNotification enable module load/unload callbacks, which raise the C++ exceptions that flow into our exception callback (module load/unload and jitted notifications), just like LLDB.
actions taken
Removed the one-shot throw catchpoint hack from the new-objfile handler. We no longer try to invoke callbacks from there.
Completed the runtime-loaded bp logic:
Ensure breakpoint pending on.
Break on coreclr_execute_assembly with a Python breakpoint that:
Marks runtime initialized, refreshes coreclr mapping, updates host PID.
Calls the managed runtime-loaded callback once.
Auto-continues (silent).
Implemented SetExceptionCallback to install a persistent C++ throw catchpoint:
Uses a Python Breakpoint('throw', type=BP_CATCHPOINT) marked silent.
stop() ignores throws until runtime-loaded has fired; then calls the exception callback and continues (silent).
If Python catchpoint creation fails, falls back to CLI catch throw and attempts to mark it silent.
Kept lldb_clear_exception_callback cleaning up any previously created catchpoint and disconnecting hooks.
Kept new-objfile hook wiring (no side-effects) so we can react to loads if needed later.
File touched:

services.py
lldb2_set_runtime_loaded_callback: finalized BP callback and ensured silent bp.
lldb_set_exception_callback: now installs persistent, silent throw catchpoint (with CLI fallback); connects new-objfile hook.
new-objfile handler: removed the previous one-shot catchpoint logic.
Static check:

No syntax/errors reported.
how this matches LLDB’s services.cpp
RuntimeLoaded: We place a pending breakpoint on coreclr_execute_assembly that calls back into the managed RuntimeLoaded handler and continues—matching the LLDB plugin’s RuntimeLoadedBpCallback behavior.
Exception callback: We install a single persistent catchpoint on C++ throws after SetExceptionCallback is called. Once runtime-loaded fired, these throws deliver the module load/unload and JITTED notifications that strike.cpp wires up, and our callback HandleExceptionNotification will receive them—same cooperation model as LLDB.
try it
Rebuild/deploy your plugin so the canonical source copies into your artifacts:

If your deploy script is flaky, re-run it and share the error if it fails—I'll help patch it. Once deployed, confirm services.py reflects these changes.
Fresh GDB session:

source sos.py
sos clrstack, then bpmd SimpleThrow.dll Simple.Main (or your target method)
run
Expect:
No visible “Catchpoint …” lines (we set bps silent).
When hitting coreclr_execute_assembly: runtime-loaded callback fires (traced), GDB continues.
Subsequently, module load/unload and JITTED exceptions are raised by the runtime; our persistent throw catchpoint invokes HandleExceptionNotification silently.
Your bpmd breakpoint binds and stops when the method is JITTED/executed; we do not auto-continue managed breakpoints.
Final exceptions still stop as usual unless you explicitly continue.
Tip: If you had manual “catch throw” set from previous sessions, clear it before testing.

Optional tracing:

SOS_PY_TRACE=1
SOS_PY_TRACE_CATEGORIES=bpmd You should see lines like:
call into lldb2_set_runtime_loaded_callback
RuntimeLoaded callback HR=0x00000000
[exception-bp] Exception callback HR=0x00000000
JITTED … / Setting breakpoint … and later the managed bp stop
progress
Aligned SetRuntimeLoadedCallback and SetExceptionCallback with the LLDB design (Done).
Removed the new-objfile one-shot trigger that could cause early DAC load (Done).
Ensured catchpoints and the runtime bp are silent and auto-continue only for the notification paths (Done).
Quality gates

Build/lint: Python file parsed; no errors detected.
Runtime: Requires your rebuild/deploy to validate in-session behavior. If bpmd doesn’t bind or managed stops don’t happen, enable bpmd tracing and share the relevant log chunk—we’ll iterate quickly.
Requirements coverage

Align behavior with LLDB plugin for runtime-loaded and exception callback cooperation with strike.cpp: Done
Avoid visible catchpoint spam; don’t over-continue normal stops: Done
Source-of-truth edits only under src/gdbplugin/sos: Done
If the deploy script continues to fail (exit 1), please share the last ~50 lines of output; I’ll fix the script or the underlying step.
