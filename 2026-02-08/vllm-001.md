Applied the bilingual policy to reports and updated the Copilot instructions to include the new rule.

Changes made:

Added the reports rule to .github/copilot-instructions.md.
Added language switch links to all existing report/snapshot files under vllm/reports.
Created zh-CN counterparts for each report:
vllm/reports/latest-vllm.zh-CN.md
vllm/reports/vllm-activity-n10-3920cafdd__HEAD-20260208-120459.zh-CN.md
vllm/reports/vllm-activity-summary-3920cafdd__HEAD-20260208-120459.zh-CN.md
vllm/reports/vllm-activity-n10-4d9513537__HEAD-20260207-154829.zh-CN.md

Next steps (optional):

Run make bilingual-check to validate the policy.
I can commit and push these changes (note: reports are ignored, so I’ll use git add -f).
