Let us cotinue to work on the dbgagent part, if I run dbgagent,I will see the below
(.venv) root ➜ /workspace (main) $ dbgagent
[dbgagent] Error: OpenRouter API key not configured (OPENROUTER_API_KEY or session config)
as dbgcopilot supportS multiple LLM providers
now I would like:

dbgagent need also supports the same multiple llm providers as dbgcopilot.
need to modify the above error msg as it supports multiple LLM providers not just openrouter.
also show help of dbgagent besides the error like the above

==========
dbgagent Upgrades

Auto-discover available LLM providers from dbgcopilot.llm.providers so --llm-provider now offers the same set as the Copilot UI, with a dynamic default and choice list (cli.py).
When startup fails—like missing credentials—the CLI now prints the detailed error plus the full dbgagent help text to guide next steps (cli.py).
Refined the OpenRouter provider message to note alternative configuration options or selecting another provider, reflecting the multi-provider support (openrouter.py).
Tests not run (pytest -q recommended if you want to validate end-to-end).
