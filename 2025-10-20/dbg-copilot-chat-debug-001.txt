User: pls help to ru
Assistant: (mock) I suggest running 'bt' and 'info locals'.
User: pls run the program
Assistant: Before running the program, let's check the current state. Would you like to see the list of breakpoints set? You can use the command `info breakpoints` for that.
User: pls run the program
Assistant: Please confirm if you would like to run the program using the command `run`.
User: run
Assistant: Please confirm that you want to start running the program with the current settings. Type "yes" to proceed or "no" to cancel.
User: yes
Assistant: Could you please clarify what you would like to proceed with? If you want to check the current breakpoints, I can run the command again or provide additional information.
pls refer the above chatlog and I would like to noidify the design and implementation as the below.
1. change the default llm provider from  mock to openrouter to save the time to switch the provider each time doing testing.
2. the above chat experience look not "good" and "natural". what I expect is like the below
user: pls run the program
assistant: I will use the command "<cmd>" to run the program, pls confirm by yes or y or let me know the other u want to try.
user: yes
assistant: ok
run /exec <cmd> and show the output

or 
user: no this command is not what I want, how aout <cmd1>
assistant: ok I will use the command "<cmd1>" 
run /exec  <cmd1> and show the output

=============

Thanks for the detailed chatlog and the expectations—I'll make two changes: set OpenRouter as the default provider and implement a natural confirmation flow for commands like “run the program.”

Plan:

Change default LLM provider to OpenRouter so you don’t have to switch each session.
Add a confirmation workflow:
If you say “run the program,” I propose a concrete command like 'run' and ask for confirmation (yes/y or no).
If you reply yes/y, I execute it and show the output.
If you reply no, I cancel and let you suggest an alternative.
If you reply with a different command (e.g., “continue”), I propose that and ask for confirmation.
Actions taken:

Default provider is now OpenRouter:
SessionState.selected_provider in state.py set to "openrouter".
Added confirmation flow in AgentOrchestrator.ask (orchestrator.py):
Tracks pending_cmd in session state.
Interprets “yes/y” to execute the pending command and return output.
Interprets “no/n” to cancel.
If a user gives an alternative command text while pending, it proposes that instead.
Attempts to infer a direct command when you say “run the program” or “continue” even before calling the LLM.
If the LLM suggests a command (detected via code quotes or patterns), it proposes that with a confirmation prompt.
Expanded REPL help text to hint at the confirmation flow.
Updated README to note default OpenRouter and the confirmation behavior.
Rebuilt and reinstalled the wheel; verified copilot command loads in GDB.
Try it now:

Start GDB with the plugin:
dbgcopilot-gdb -q
In GDB: copilot
In the copilot prompt, try the flow you described:
user: pls run the program
assistant: I will use the command 'run' to proceed. Please confirm with yes/y, or say no to cancel or suggest another command.
user: yes
assistant: ok
The assistant will run the command and print the output right after “ok”.
To try an alternative:
user: no this command is not what I want, how about continue
assistant: I will use the command 'continue'. Please confirm with yes/y, or say no to cancel.
user: yes
Executes 'continue' and shows output.
Notes:

OpenRouter is the default now; ensure your OpenRouter API key is set in the environment so calls succeed.
The extraction of suggested commands uses simple heuristics (quotes, /exec patterns, and known commands). We can refine it as we see more examples.
If you want any tweaks to the phrasing (“ok” vs “executing...”), or to support other short answers (like “yep”/“nah”), say the word and I’ll adjust.
