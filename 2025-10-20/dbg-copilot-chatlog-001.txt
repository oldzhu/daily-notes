Implemented /chatlog in the GDB REPL

File: repl.py
Added a new slash-command /chatlog that prints the session’s chat transcript (SessionState.chatlog).
Limited output to the last 200 lines to avoid flooding GDB.
Updated help text and README

Added /chatlog to the REPL help list.
Updated README.md UX summary and “Using the copilot prompt” example to include /chatlog.
files changed
repl.py — added /chatlog handling and updated help text.
README.md — documented /chatlog usage.
how to use
Inside GDB after loading the plugin:

Run copilot to enter the nested prompt.
Use /chatlog anytime to view the Q/A transcript:
Shows the most recent 200 lines from SessionState.chatlog.
If there’s no chat yet, it tells you.
Example:

(gdb) copilot
copilot> /chatlog
quality gates
Build: PASS (no build artifacts changed; Python edits only)
Lint/Typecheck: PASS (no errors reported on edited files)
Tests: No explicit tests for the REPL; existing smoke test discovered none to run
notes
This is a minimal, safe addition: it doesn’t change session behavior, only adds visibility.
If you want pagination or filtering later (e.g., last N exchanges), we can extend /chatlog with options like /chatlog 50 or /chatlog since <id>.
