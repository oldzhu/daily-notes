Pls review our project code and architecture which is under src/gdbplugin, please understand our design goal is make gdb support .net debugging with minimal coding cost, for that goal, we decide to align with lldb C++ plugin under submodule diagnostics - which is under src/diagnostics/src/SOS/lldbplugin, in that way, we only need to implement the lldb plugin interfaces and other things required by SOS extenstions, then we can re-use the most implementations in SOS and others staffs in dianostics which are already done for .net debugging. One of my thing I want to check is that if it is really must to have the small gdb native c++ bridge code, why I am asking is becuase that if we have pure python solutions, then that would simplify the building/package/release, otherwise, we have to maintain different sets of the building/package/release for different {ARCH} - x64,arm64, riscv...

===============
Thanks for laying out the goal. I reviewed the plugin under src/gdbplugin and the Diagnostics lldb plugin you’re aligning to. Here’s a focused assessment on whether the native bridge is truly required and what a pure-Python path would entail.

What the native bridge actually does (why it exists)
Files to look at:

gdbbridge.cpp
sos.py
services.py
Diagnostics submodule: lldbplugin + shared hosting/Extensions
The tiny C++ bridge is a thin adapter around the Diagnostics “Extensions”/host stack:

Creates the Diagnostics Extensions singleton wired with your Python-implemented IDebuggerServices (InitGdbExtensions).
Exposes a C ABI to:
Initialize managed hosting (InitManagedHosting)
Provide the native IHost* to SOS (GetHostForSos)
Dispatch managed commands (DispatchManagedCommand)
Update managed target PID (UpdateManagedTarget)
In Python (sos.py), you:
Load libsos and the bridge (co-located)
Initialize Extensions via InitGdbExtensions(IDEbuggerServices*)
Get the IHost* from the bridge and pass it to SOSInitializeByHost(host, &IDebuggerServices)
Call into SOS for managed/native commands, reusing Diagnostics logic
This mirrors the LLDB plugin shape so that SOS and Diagnostics code paths are reused almost unchanged.

Could we remove the native bridge and go pure Python?
Short answer: Technically possible in theory, but impractical if you want feature parity and reliability with minimal ongoing cost.

Why:

Hosting and Extensions live in native Diagnostics
The managed-host bootstrapping, lifecycle, target creation/update, and many “plumbing” bits are implemented in native code (Extensions, HostServices). Your bridge simply taps into that, instead of rewriting it.
SOSInitializeByHost expects a native IHost* that participates in that native ecosystem
You do construct Python-side vtables for IHost/IDebuggerServices via ctypes. In principle you could pass a Python-implemented IHost pointer to SOS. Practically, doing so means you must then replicate the rest of the host responsibilities that Extensions provides (or rely on undocumented behaviors inside libsos), including:
Hosting initialization and runtime flavor selection
Target creation/update, service routing, and dispatch
Callbacks, thread-safety, and reentrancy semantics
You previously tried a Python-host fallback and removed it to avoid “creating a 2nd host/runtime” and subtle reliability issues.
The libsos “forwarders” are not a substitute for the bridge
You do try SOS_InitManagedHosting and SOS_DispatchManagedCommand when available, but they still presuppose the Diagnostics host/Extensions is properly wired. That’s exactly what the bridge ensures (by initializing Extensions with your IDebuggerServices and furnishing a real IHost).
Reentrancy and ABI stability
GDB’s Python runtime + ctypes callbacks into native code can get gnarly with reentrancy. Moving more of the host-side logic back into Python increases risk. You’ve already mitigated similar issues by moving “continue” onto event posts and keeping the host logic native.
Bottom line: Eliminating the bridge would force you to re-implement the Diagnostics host in Python or rely on less stable call patterns inside libsos. That’s a big maintenance burden and likely to regress parity and stability.

Why keeping the bridge is the lowest-cost path
It’s small and stable: gdbbridge.cpp is tiny and calls straight into Diagnostics host APIs.
It buys you full reuse of Diagnostics code (the entire reason to align with LLDB).
It isolates tricky hosting/runtime lifecycles in native code that already works and is battle-tested.
Packaging/build per-arch is manageable and already automated in your workflow (and we split symbols cleanly).
If you still want a Python-only mode
If you want a fallback/prototype mode for experiments or constrained scenarios:

Force-disable host usage in Python:
SOS_GDB_USE_HOST=0 to take the “NULL host” path you already wired, skipping the bridge.
Expect limitations:
Some managed commands may fail or be flaky because Extensions/host isn’t fully initialized.
Error handling and runtime lifecycle may not match LLDB parity.
Guard it clearly:
Advertise as “experimental Python-only mode” for quick smoke tests, not for production use.
We can also add a targeted probe to detect missing bridge and present a friendly message: “Running in limited hostless mode; some features may be unavailable. Set SOS_GDB_USE_HOST=1 and ensure libsosgdbbridge.so is co-located with libsos.so.”

Reducing the cost of multi-arch builds
If the main concern is packaging/build matrix rather than code:

Matrix builds in GitHub Actions: add arm64 (self-hosted or via Graviton runner) and optionally riscv64 (self-hosted).
Consider prebuilt release assets only for the archs you care about. Add more later.
For portability: compile the bridge with conservative glibc and no exotic deps. You’re already splitting symbols and keeping the runtime tar lean.
Longer-term: publish prebuilt wheels (manylinux/musllinux) on PyPI bundling the tiny .so next to the Python files; users pip install gdbsos and get the right native blob for their platform.
Recommendation
Keep the native bridge. It’s the glue that lets you reuse the Diagnostics host with minimal code and high reliability.
Treat Python-only as an opt-in experimental mode for limited scenarios, not the primary path.
Use CI matrix to build required archs, and keep the bridge tiny to minimize maintenance.
If you want, I can:

Add a user-facing “experimental hostless mode” help text and soft warning when the bridge isn’t found.
Extend the CI to an arch matrix (x64 + arm64) and keep packaging consistent.
Document the modes in README so users understand when the native bridge is required.
