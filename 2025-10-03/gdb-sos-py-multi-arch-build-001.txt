After read your analysis, I decide to keep native nridge at the current stage and let me consider on the below stafs u mentioned.
....
Reducing the cost of multi-arch builds
If the main concern is packaging/build matrix rather than code:

Matrix builds in GitHub Actions: add arm64 (self-hosted or via Graviton runner) and optionally riscv64 (self-hosted).
Consider prebuilt release assets only for the archs you care about. Add more later.
For portability: compile the bridge with conservative glibc and no exotic deps. You’re already splitting symbols and keeping the runtime tar lean.
Longer-term: publish prebuilt wheels (manylinux/musllinux) on PyPI bundling the tiny .so next to the Python files; users pip install gdbsos and get the right native blob for their platform.
....
Extend the CI to an arch matrix (x64 + arm64) and keep packaging consistent.
....
could u list plan how to do but do not apply any real change. I will review and check, will ask if there are any questions.
==============
Great call. Here’s a clear, no-change plan you can review before we implement anything.

Multi-arch release plan (x64 + arm64)
Choose ARM64 runner strategy
Prefer GitHub-hosted arm64 if available (e.g., ubuntu-22.04-arm64). If not:
Self-hosted arm64 on local hardware or cloud (AWS Graviton).
Label it (e.g., self-hosted, linux, arm64) and target via runs-on.
Avoid cross-compile/QEMU for now to keep native deps (LLDB, lttng) straightforward.
Extend workflow with arch matrix
Add strategy.matrix: arch: [x64, arm64].
Map matrix to runs-on:
x64 → ubuntu-latest (or ubuntu-20.04 if you want older glibc).
arm64 → ubuntu-22.04-arm64 (hosted) or self-hosted label.
Keep inputs/tag handling as-is so both matrix jobs build the same tag.
Install dependencies per-arch
In the install step, apt-get for:
ninja-build, clang, liblttng-ust-dev, lldb, liblldb-dev
These packages exist for both x64 and arm64 on Ubuntu.
Optional: add basic retry or use -yq to reduce flakiness.
Build and package per-arch
Run: build.sh -c Release --package --tag "$TAG"
Script already maps arch via uname -m (x86_64→x64, aarch64→arm64).
Artifacts:
artifacts/gdbsos-linux-{ARCH}-Release-{TAG}.tar.gz (no .dbg)
artifacts/gdbsos-linux-{ARCH}-Release-{TAG}.symbols.tar.gz (only .dbg)
sha256 files for both
Upload release assets
Single upload step with globs covering both arches:
artifacts/gdbsos-linux--Release-${TAG}.tar.gz
artifacts/gdbsos-linux--Release-${TAG}.tar.gz.sha256
artifacts/gdbsos-linux--Release-${TAG}.symbols.tar.gz
artifacts/gdbsos-linux--Release-${TAG}.symbols.tar.gz.sha256
To simplify re-runs, set overwrite: true on the gh-release step.
Optional per-arch smoke test
After build, quick sanity:
gdb --version
gdb -q -ex "python import sys" -ex "quit"
Optionally: gdb -q -ex "source ./src/gdbplugin/sos/sos.py" -ex "quit" just to ensure it loads without running libsos.
Stability and caching
Consider caching diagnostics’ .dotnet toolset to speed builds:
actions/cache keyed by OS+arch + a known diagnostics version marker.
Avoid caching build outputs across arches (complexity vs benefit).
Glibc compatibility choice
If you want broader compatibility:
Pin x64 to ubuntu-20.04; for arm64, use the oldest available hosted image.
Alternative: run build inside a Docker image with older glibc on both runners.
Future: PyPI wheels
Later, publish platform wheels bundling the tiny bridge .so with Python files via cibuildwheel:
manylinux/musllinux x64 & arm64 first.
Keep your GitHub Release flow for tarballs in parallel.
If you’re happy with this, I can implement the matrix workflow and the optional smoke test next.
