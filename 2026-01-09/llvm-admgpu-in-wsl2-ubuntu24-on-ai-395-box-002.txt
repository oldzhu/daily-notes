Created a new end-to-end (compile-only) walkthrough plus runnable examples and real captured outputs.

New doc: frontend-to-amdgpu.md
New examples:
llvm_add_kernel.ll (LLVM IR kernel → gfx1151 asm via llc)
mlir_gpu_ids.mlir (MLIR GPU → ROCDL/LLVM dialect via mlir-opt)
c_vecadd_host.c (C → LLVM IR via clang)
Generated outputs (already produced once, rerunnable anytime):
llvm_add_kernel.gfx1151.s
mlir_gpu_ids.rocdl.mlir
c_vecadd_host.ll
Also added a pointer to the new doc in README.md.

If you want, I can next add a small “single-command” snippet to frontend-to-amdgpu.md that regenerates all three outputs in one go.
