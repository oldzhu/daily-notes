Updated the fallback debugger console so you can type commands right after the (gdb)/(lldb) prompt—no more separate Run box—while the UI still auto-focuses that input and keeps output scrollback.

app.js: replaced the old form-based fallback with a prompt+contenteditable line that echoes commands into the scrollback, tracks prompt text, and routes Enter presses through dispatchDebuggerCommand, plus polished placeholder/focus behavior.
styles.css: restyled the fallback terminal to match the new inline input line and removed the unused form/button styles.
Reload the web UI without xterm.js and confirm you can type after the prompt and press Enter to run commands; let me know if you want history or interrupt support next.

Updated the fallback prompt text to “waiting for debugger…” so it’s clear this message comes from the debugger, not the LLM. Added a closeSession FastAPI endpoint plus matching frontend logic: the Start Session button now flips to “Stop Session” while a session is active, closes the backend session via the new DELETE route, tears down both WebSocket streams, and resets the UI state when you stop. Relevant files: routes.py, app.js.

Reload the web UI and use the button to start/stop a session to confirm. Restart the FastAPI server if it was already running so the new DELETE route is available. Let me know if you’d rather keep the “waitting” spelling.
