Build complete — I created both sdist and wheel artifacts.

What I did

Installed the build tool in the environment.
Ran python -m build which produced:
dbgcopilot-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
dbgcopilot-0.0.1.tar.gz
What’s included in the wheel

The dbgcopilot package with cli, core, backends, llm, utils and the registered entry point dbgcopilot-plugin-path.
Note: examples and tests are included in sdist (by default), but tests are not installed into site-packages by pip install of the wheel.
How users install and use it

Install the wheel (local test):

pip install dist/dbgcopilot-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
Verify the CLI path printer:

dbgcopilot-plugin-path# prints the absolute path to copilot_cmd.py
In GDB, source the plugin using the helper:

(gdb) source $(dbgcopilot-plugin-path)
Notes & next steps

I fixed pyproject.toml to declare requests>=2.28 and added the console script dbgcopilot-plugin-path.
The wheel was built inside an isolated build environment; all tests were run earlier and are passing.
If you'd like, I can:
Publish the wheel to PyPI/TestPyPI (requires credentials).
Add a small Makefile or GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests and publishes on tag.
Add a short README snippet in the repo describing how to install the wheel and source the plugin from GDB.
Would you like me to install the wheel into the current environment and run a quick smoke test (import and run dbgcopilot-plugin-path), or should I pause here for you to test locally?
