Perfect — that means it really sent.

Next (confirm it landed + be ready to reply)

Wait ~5–15 minutes (sometimes faster).
Check on lore (LKML mirror). Easiest searches:

If you see it there, you’re officially “in the system”.

What happens now

You’ll likely get either: no reply (still OK), a quick “applied, thanks”, or a small review nit.
If someone asks for changes, you’ll send v2:
edit + amend commit
git format-patch -1 -v2 --output-directory outgoing HEAD
git send-email --in-reply-to <Message-ID> outgoing/0001-...v2...patch ... (keeps it threaded)
One small improvement (optional)
Right now you CC yourself automatically. That’s harmless, but if you want to stop it:

git config --global sendemail.suppresscc all
If you paste the lore link once it appears, I’ll tell you exactly what to watch for (maintainer feedback patterns, when to resend, and how to track if/when it gets applied).
