Nope — that file is clean now. It’s very short, and the grep for common misspellings found nothing after the occurred fix. So we should not expand the commit further.

About SMTP: can you use Gmail SMTP with a Hotmail From address?

In practice: not reliably. Kernel submission expects the From: address to be a real, reply-able address, and modern mail systems enforce SPF/DKIM/DMARC.
If you authenticate to Gmail SMTP but send with From: wp_xdzhu@hotmail.com, Gmail will typically either:
rewrite the From/sender, or
add “via gmail.com”, or
get the message rejected/quarantined by recipients due to DMARC alignment.
So the “simplest / least trouble” path is: use the SMTP provider that matches your From address.
Given your From is wp_xdzhu@hotmail.com, simplest options are:

Use Outlook/Hotmail SMTP (recommended)
Works best when From == authenticated account.
Caveat: Microsoft sometimes requires app-password / “SMTP AUTH” enabled; if basic password auth is blocked, it gets a bit annoying.
Use a Gmail account as your kernel From (alternative)
Create/use yourname@gmail.com only for kernel work.
Then using Gmail SMTP is straightforward (app password) and deliverability is usually good.
But the visible From would be the Gmail address, not your Hotmail.
Next step: set up host-side git send-email
Before I give you the exact minimal commands/config, one detail decides everything:

Do you want to send as wp_xdzhu@hotmail.com (then we target Outlook SMTP), or are you OK sending as a Gmail address (easier)?
Reply with one of:

“Use Hotmail From”
“Use Gmail From”
and I’ll give you the exact git config + SMTP settings + a dry-run send (--dry-run) for your prepared patch in ~/mylinux/linux/outgoing/.
