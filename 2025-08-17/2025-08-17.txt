two things thought today

1. how to use the latest LLVM toolchain built by buildroot such as clang to build .net runtime
2. how to fix the compilation erros which seems caused by could not find headers

action:

-cmakeargs "-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$hostlldbpath/llvm/buildroot-build/bin/clang++" \
-cmakeargs "-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$hostlldbpath/llvm/buildroot-build/bin/clang"

issue 1:

  /home/oldzhu/buildroot/output/build/dotnetruntime-origin_risc-v/src/native/libs/System.Net.Security.Native/pal_gssapi.c:247:11: error: implicit conversion when initializing 'char *' with an expression of type 'void *' is not permitted in C++ [-Werror,-Wimplicit-void-ptr-cast]
    247 |     char* ptrSlash = memchr(inputName, '/', inputNameLen);
        |           ^          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
