I tested radare2 in dbgcopilot REPL and saw one issue not sure if it also impact the other debuggers, pls refer the below:
Proposed debugger command:
radare2> dc
Run it? (y(es)/n(o)/a(uto yes))
copilot> y
ERROR: Cannot continue, run ood?
radare2> dc
The program appears to have run and potentially crashed. Let's check the current state and see what happened. I'll examine the backtrace and registers to understand the crash context.
Proposed debugger command:
radare2> dr
Run it? (y(es)/n(o)/a(uto yes))
copilot> y
radare2> dr
rax = 0x00000000
rbx = 0x00000000
rcx = 0x00000000
....
MY question is that did the dbgcopilot send the "ERROR: Cannot continue, run ood?" which is error rreturned from radare2 executing dc? why I suspect it is not sending becuase 1. I didn't see the error in /chatlog 2. from the llm reply, it suggest to run dr but not ood just like it didnot see the error.
pls investigate and try to fix.
Another two issues

the debugging session of radare2 is not like the other debuggers, the prompt is not static and it is dynamic like [0x<addr>] , in dbgcopilot we could see this dynamic prompt, but in dbgcopilot and webui front end ofr radare2, we are using static prompt and that give the user different debugging experience as using radare2 directly, I want to using the same dynamic prompt as we saw in radare2 directly.
the webui of radare2 seems has no color of the debugger command output, but debugger output has color when run radara2 and run dbgcopilot using radare2

=============

Handled all three radare2 issues:

wired log capture using temp files so command errors (like dc’s “ERROR: Cannot continue, run ood?”) flow back into the LLM/chat; merged logs with stdout before queuing.
restored ANSI-rich output and dynamic prompts by re-enabling scr.color and querying s on every command; the backend now exports prompts like [0x1080]> so both REPL and web UI match native radare2.
kept prompts updated on restart/exit and cleaned up temp log files.
Touched radare2_subprocess.py. Tests: pytest -q.

Next idea if you want more polish: surface the new prompt in the web UI header (currently it only shows at the bottom prompt).

===========

ok let us also show dynamic prompt next to the command input box. another small issue is that in webui, auto-approve check box is not synced with the chioce to the llm proposed command, I mean if click auto approval button to the llm reply proposed command, the auto-approve check box id dtill unchecked and not synced with that user choice.

==========
Added prompt-aware output handling in app.js, so the fallback debugger input now shows the live backend prompt (e.g., [0x1080]>) instead of a fixed string while preserving ANSI styling in the log panel.
Synced the web UI auto-approve checkbox with the “Auto-Approve” decision on chat proposals by reusing the existing session API, keeping the UI state consistent after approving via the assistant.
Extended radare2_subprocess.py to expose dynamic prompts and log-backed error output that feed the UI updates.
Tests: pytest -q

Next: Reload the web UI, start a radare2 session, and confirm the prompt and auto-approve toggle behave as expected.
