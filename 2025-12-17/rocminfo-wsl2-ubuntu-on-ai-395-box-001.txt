HSA System Attributes
These lines describe the "Health and Capabilities" of the link between your Windows host and the WSL2 Linux guest.

Runtime Version: 1.1 / Ext Version: 1.7: This is the version of the HSA (Heterogeneous System Architecture) software layer.

Machine Model: LARGE: Indicates a 64-bit system with a large memory address space.

XNACK enabled: NO: XNACK allows for GPU page faults (similar to virtual memory on a CPU). It is usually disabled on consumer hardware; this is normal.

DMAbuf Support: YES: Crucial for WSL2. This allows the GPU to share memory buffers directly with the Linux environment without expensive copying.

Agent 1: The "Identity Crisis"
In a standard desktop with a discrete GPU, Agent 1 is usually the CPU and Agent 2 is the GPU. On your Ryzen AI Max+, ROCm is seeing the integrated nature of the chip.

Name: AMD RYZEN AI MAX+ 395 w/ Radeon 8060S: ROCm correctly identifies your specific hardware string from the Windows driver.

Vendor Name: CPU / Device Type: CPU: This is the most important part. Even though it lists the "Radeon 8060S" in the name, it is labeling the device type as CPU.

Why? In WSL2, integrated GPUs often appear as a unified agent. This is exactly why you must use the HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0 variable later—to tell llama.cpp to treat this "CPU" agent as a GPU capable of running graphics kernels.

Compute Unit: 32: This is a great sign! It is seeing the 32 Compute Units of your Radeon 8060S. This confirms the hardware abstraction is working.

Memory Pools (The RAM)
Because this is an APU, your "Video RAM" is actually part of your System RAM.

Pool 1-4 (GLOBAL): These represent the different ways the system can allocate memory.

Size: 16187520 KB (~15.4 GB): This is the amount of memory currently visible to the ROCm runtime in WSL2.

Note: If you have 32GB or 64GB of RAM, Windows is currently "carving out" about 16GB for the GPU/WSL. You can often increase this in your BIOS (UMA Framebuffer size) or via a .wslconfig file.

Flags: FINE GRAINED / COARSE GRAINED:

Fine Grained: The CPU and GPU can "see" the same memory at the same time (excellent for APUs).

Coarse Grained: Standard GPU memory behavior where data is moved in larger chunks.

What is missing? (The ISA Info)
You'll notice the output cuts off or doesn't show a gfx1151 identifier under ISA Info. This confirms that the ROCm library in Ubuntu doesn't natively "know" the instruction set architecture (ISA) of the 8060S yet.

Summary for your Build: Since rocminfo sees 32 Compute Units but labels the device as a CPU, your build of llama.cpp will only work if you:

Compile with AMDGPU_TARGETS="gfx1100" (to provide the code instructions).

Run with HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0 (to tell the driver "Ignore the CPU label, use the GPU instructions for this agent").
