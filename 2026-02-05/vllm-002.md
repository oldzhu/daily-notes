Regenerated — the “Recent commits” table now contains clickable GitHub links for each commit (links go to the commit diff page).

How it works

The script auto-detects remote.origin.url from your vLLM repo and builds links like https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/commit/<full_sha>.
In your case it detected https://github.com/oldzhu/vllm (so links point to your fork). If you prefer upstream links, run with --github-base https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm.
Also pushed the script change to GitHub in commit 5f90fe5.
