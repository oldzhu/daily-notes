In the context of VS Code networking, the setting **`http: Proxy Support`** set to **`override`** is actually the most aggressive (and usually best) mode for handling proxies.

Here is what it means and why it might be contributing to your current "spinning" loop:

### **1. What "Override" actually does**

* **The Default Behavior:** Standard tools in VS Code use the built-in Node.js "fetch" or "http" modules.
* **The Override Behavior:** When set to `override`, VS Code **forcibly replaces** the low-level networking logic for **all extensions** (including Copilot). It tells them: *"Do not look at your own settings. Use the proxy I have defined in the VS Code settings, and I will handle the connection for you."*

### **2. Why this is failing for you in WSL2**

You mentioned your Windows host proxy is `127.0.0.1:10808`.

If your VS Code **User** settings (which are shared between Windows and WSL) have `http.proxy` set to `127.0.0.1:10808`, and `proxySupport` is set to `override`:

1. Copilot starts up inside WSL2.
2. VS Code "overrides" Copilot's network and forces it to use `127.0.0.1:10808`.
3. **Result:** Copilot tries to find the proxy inside the Linux VM's localhost. It fails because the proxy is on the Windows localhost.

### **How to fix this specific conflict**

#### **Step A: Separate the "Remote" setting**

You need to make sure the WSL version of VS Code uses the **Host IP** while the Windows version (if you use it) keeps using `127.0.0.1`.

1. Open **Settings** (`Ctrl+,`).
2. Select the **Remote [WSL: Ubuntu]** tab (do not stay on the "User" tab).
3. Set `Http: Proxy` to **`http://172.20.32.1:10808`** (your Windows Host IP).
4. Leave `Http: Proxy Support` as **`override`**.
5. **Important:** Go to the **User** tab and ensure the proxy setting there is **empty** or correct for Windows.

#### **Step B: Try setting Proxy Support to "on" instead of "override"**

If `override` is causing issues with how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) handles its local tool connections (which sometimes need to bypass the proxy), try changing it:

* Set **`Http: Proxy Support`** to **`on`**.
* This enables proxy support but is less "forceful" than override, allowing extensions to use their own fallback logic if they need to reach local addresses.

#### **Step C: The "No Proxy" setting**

Since Copilot is spinning on "Activating MCP extensions," it might be trying to connect to a local MCP server *inside* WSL and getting accidentally routed through your Windows proxy.

1. In your WSL terminal, add this to your `~/.bashrc`:
```bash
export no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1,::1"
export NO_PROXY="localhost,127.0.0.1,::1"

```


2. Restart the VS Code server (Command Palette: `Developer: Kill VS Code Server on Host...`).

### **Summary**

`Override` is good because it forces extensions to follow the rules, but it's currently forcing Copilot in WSL to follow **Windows rules** (`127.0.0.1`), which don't work inside Linux.

Would you like me to show you how to check if your proxy software is blocking the connection from the "LAN" (WSL side) even if you have the IP right?
