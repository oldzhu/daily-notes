Yes, if you set the global **"strip target binaries"** option in `menuconfig`, Buildroot will apply that logic to **every package** it installs into the `/target` directory (the directory used to create your `rootfs.ext4`).

Here is how that process works and how it affects your custom `lldb` package:

### 1. The Global Strip Logic

When the global strip is enabled, Buildroot runs a "target-finalize" script at the very end of the build.

* It scans `/home/oldzhu/buildroot/output/target/` for all ELF files (binaries and `.so` libraries).
* It runs the cross-strip tool (`aarch64-linux-strip`) on every one of them.
* **Result:** Every package, including your custom LLDB/LLVM, will be stripped before the filesystem image is created.

### 2. How to "Split" Symbols (Keep the Debug Info)

If you want to strip the files to fix the `mkfs` error but **still keep the symbols** for debugging on your host PC, you should use the **Staging** directory logic.

1. In your custom LLDB package's `.mk` file, ensure you have:
`HOST_LLDB_INSTALL_STAGING = YES` (or `LLDB_INSTALL_STAGING = YES`).
2. When Buildroot builds your package, it will install the "fat" (2GB) version into `output/staging/`.
3. Buildroot then copies the files to `output/target/`.
4. The **Global Strip** only touches `output/target/`.
5. **The Result:** You get a small, 150MB library in your `rootfs.ext4` image (which fixes the error), but you still have the full 2GB library with all symbols in your `staging` folder to use with GDB on your host.

### 3. Can you strip only ONE package?

If you don't want to strip everything globally, you can manually strip just your LLVM library within your package's `.mk` file. Add a post-install hook to your custom package:

```makefile
define LLDB_STRIP_LLVM_LIB
    $(TARGET_STRIP) $(TARGET_DIR)/usr/lib/libLLVM.so.22.0git
endef

LLDB_POST_INSTALL_TARGET_HOOKS += LLDB_STRIP_LLVM_LIB

```

*Note: `$(TARGET_STRIP)` is a Buildroot variable that points to the correct `aarch64-linux-strip` tool.*

### Summary Recommendation

The cleanest way is to **enable the global strip** in `menuconfig`. Most people do this for production or embedded builds because you almost never want debug symbols taking up space on the actual device's SD card or flash chip.

As long as you have the symbols in your `output/build/` or `output/staging/` folders, you haven't "lost" the ability to debug; you've just made the runtime image small enough to actually work.

**Would you like me to check the syntax of your custom LLDB `.mk` file to make sure the staging and target installation paths are set up correctly?**
