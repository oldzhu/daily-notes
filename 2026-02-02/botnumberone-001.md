u know moltbot which now is openclaw is at https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw ,now I cloned it into my local ~/moltbot, I would like to use it as reference to learn and and to plan and to design and to implement myself minimum self-evolving agent which can grow and extend its skills and capbilities as need and also has long time memory locally as openclaw, pls review and let me now what is architecture and how it is planned and designed and implemented to be a auto-evolving personal ai assistant which can do almost anything - including something it does not know how to do at beginning. I will develope my self auto-evolving agent at ~/botnumberone and pls create all analysis documents of oepnclaw and all our plan/design/implementation/discussion/progress/implementation into ~/botnumberone as long time local memory for our project development.
