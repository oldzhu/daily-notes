Removed the debugger-log data structures from SessionState and restored the prior _execute_and_format flow so commands behave exactly as before.
Dropped the /dbglog handler and related help text in standalone.py, along with the extra logging hook in session_manager.py.
The REPL and dbgweb now operate just like they did prior to the /dbglog experiment; no additional logging is performed.
Let me know if you’d like to explore a different approach for surfacing radare2 signal output.

Now let's run the program to see the crash. We'll use `dc` (continue) to execute it.
