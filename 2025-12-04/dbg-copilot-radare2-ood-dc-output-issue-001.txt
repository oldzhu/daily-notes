I found some issues only occurs for radarae2 backend
1. if run try to debug the same program in radare2 directly, you could see thge outout as the below:
(.venv) root ➜ /workspace (main) $ radare2 examples/bin/c/crash
WARN: Relocs has not been applied. Please use `-e bin.relocs.apply=true` or `-e bin.cache=true` next time
 -- Press 'c' in visual mode to toggle the cursor mode
[0x00001080]> ood
WARN: Environment corrupted after null bytes injected via r_sys_setenv2
WARN: Environment corrupted after null bytes injected via r_sys_setenv2
INFO: File dbg:///workspace/examples/bin/c/crash reopened in read-write mode
[0x7471a639d540]> dc 
Crash demo starting...
[+] SIGNAL 11 (aka SIGSEGV) errno=0 addr=0x00000000 code=1 si_pid=0 ret=0
[0x5c766235f17d]> 
2. if try the same command in dbgcopilot with radare2, you would see the output as the below:
copilot> /exec ood
[0x1080]> ood
INFO: File dbg:///workspace/examples/bin/c/crash reopened in read-write mode
INFO: File dbg:///workspace/examples/bin/c/crash reopened in read-write mode
copilot> /exec dc
[0x774a76c2f540]> dc
[+] SIGNAL 11 (aka SIGSEGV) errno=0 addr=0x00000000 code=1 si_pid=0 ret=0
Crash demo starting...
copilot> 
3. if run the same in dbgweb debugger console frame, you could see the output as the below:

[0x1080]> ood
INFO: File dbg:///workspace/examples/bin/c/crash reopened in read-write mode
 
[0x7967aea1a540]> 
 
[0x7967aea1a540]> dc
Crash demo starting...

based on the above output, if treat the 1st output (run in radare2 directly) as the standard, we could see the below issues:
1. in dbgcopilot repl output,, there is no two WARN msgs and there are duplicate INFO  msgs after /exec ood. {in radare2 there are 2 WARN and only 1 INFO after ood). 
[+] SIGNAL output coming before the crash demo starting. after /exec dc(in radare2 after dc,crash demostarting.. coming before [+] SIGNAL )
2. in dbgweb debugger concole, after ood, there are no TWO WARN msgs too , there is only one INFO wihich does match with radare2. after dc, there is only Crash demo starting... and there is no [+] SIGNAL output.

We expect to see the same as run command in radare2 for bothdbgcopilot repl and dbgweb.
there is test_radare2_fixes.py u can use or modify to test the output behavior for running command ood,dc and investigate why and try to fix
