I will keep the gdb script but not use now as I found one interesting thing:
u gdbbridge.cpp of the GetHost implementaion if the code is like the below, no hang but quickly we will see DAC not found falure 0x80004002. 

    IHost* GetHost() override {
        if (m_pHost == nullptr) {
            // Initialize the hosting runtime which will call InitializeHostServices
            // and provide a host instance via the callback.
            InitializeHosting();
        }
        return m_pHost;
    }

    but if I comment the part to initiaze Hosting like the below, then we will see the block.

        IHost* GetHost() override {
            /*if (m_pHost == nullptr) {
                // Initialize the hosting runtime which will call InitializeHostServices
                // and provide a host instance via the callback.
                InitializeHosting();
            }*/
            return m_pHost;
        }
why I comment the above part of the code beause in the debug build it would cusae the crash like the below when 1st time run bpmd before r to start the target program.

seems like DAC failure or hang is related with how GetHost behaves.
Could we check in lldb plugin scenario how GetHost and wha tsre difference between us?

========================

Analyzing differences and preparing explanation and potential patch for lazy init to avoid early managed init before runtime. GitHub Copilot

Root cause picture:

Two distinct initialization paths

LLDB (and dbgeng) pattern: Native plugin (libsosplugin / dbgeng host) calls managed HostServices.Initialize via InitializeHosting() only after it has a valid debugger services instance and (critically) at a time when starting the managed host won’t re-enter debugger APIs in a fragile state.
Your GDB adaptation: GetHost() unconditionally calls InitializeHosting() the first time SOS/native needs a host, even if the managed runtime hasn’t been loaded or Python side isn’t yet ready. This fires the managed pipeline (HostServices.Initialize → HostServices.RegisterDebuggerServices → CreateTarget/UpdateTarget) early.
What happens in the two variants you tried

Version A (current code – call InitializeHosting when m_pHost == nullptr): Early managed hosting starts. In Debug build you hit the HostServices assertion/fail because the managed assembly expects to complete the callback sequence (InitializeHostServices → RegisterDebuggerServices → CreateTarget) with consistent state; something (probably missing debugger service state or reentrancy) breaks → assertion / termination. In Release build, the early init “works” far enough that GetHost() returns a host pointer, but later when you run the target (r) the Python/GDB side tries DAC load before the runtime module is mapped → “Failed to find runtime module (libcoreclr.so), 0x80004002”. That HRESULT (E_NOINTERFACE) surfaces because Extensions doesn’t yet see a target/runtime (UpdateTarget returned before runtime present).
Version B (commenting out the InitializeHosting call): m_pHost stays null. Later, some code path (e.g. your Python DAC acquisition path calling into CLRDataCreateInstance) triggers behavior that now blocks (the previous early managed host bootstrap side-effects that avoided the hang are absent). The hang likely occurs because CLRDataCreateInstance is invoked without the managed host’s earlier side effects (environment / loader / thread states) that incidentally prevented the blocking condition.
Why removing early hosting changes hang vs. fail mode

Early hosting creates a managed host, which among other things spins up .NET loader state and may touch environment / initialize PAL; this may avoid (or shift timing of) the eventual blocking call inside DAC (your earlier observed GetEnvironmentVariableA hang). Without it, your direct inline DAC call occurs in a “colder” process state and hits the hang path.
Conversely, early hosting happens before the target program is actually executing managed code, so the host cannot locate libcoreclr.so yet, producing 0x80004002 for SOS commands needing a runtime (expected if done too early).
LLDB difference

In the official SOS flow, SOSExtensions::GetHost() (see sosextensions.cpp) only calls InitializeHosting() on Windows (#ifndef FEATURE_PAL). On Linux/macOS (FEATURE_PAL defined), it skips that and falls back to a locally created host later, because the LLDB plugin already supplied the host (comment says libsosplugin got it via InitializeHostServices callback).
Your GDB variant always calls InitializeHosting() when null, on FEATURE_PAL platform, which diverges from LLDB behavior. So you’re doing a “dbgeng style” eager managed host bootstrap on Linux where LLDB logic would not.
HostServices assertion (line ~123 context)

The Debug termination you saw (“Assertion Failed at HostServices.Initialize”) corresponds to Debug.Assert(Instance == null); in HostServices.Initialize. This fires if Initialize is invoked twice (or host state re-enters unexpectedly). Early calling InitializeHosting() via GetHost() and later calling again via another path can trip this because the callback sequence re-runs.
Or if extensionPath or callback loading is inconsistent due to partial initialization, the assertion plus exception cause process abort.
Actionable fix strategy:

Goal: Defer managed hosting until we actually have (a) runtime module mapped OR (b) an SOS command that truly requires managed host, while keeping a fast path for “bpmd before run” scenario by not forcing DAC/hosting prematurely.

Recommended adjustments in gdbbridge.cpp:

Make GetHost() pure lazy but non-forcing: return m_pHost if set; otherwise return nullptr (don’t trigger InitializeHosting). This mimics LLDB on PAL (where plugin supplies host later).
Provide an explicit exported function EnsureManagedHosting(processId, runtimeDir, majorVersion) the Python layer can call after it detects libcoreclr.so mapping (your _scan_coreclr path already finds it). That function:
Calls InitManagedHosting(runtimeDir, majorVersion) if not already initialized.
Calls UpdateManagedTarget(processId).
In Python:
After successful runtime detection, call the new ensure API before attempting DAC (or right after to see if it influences the hang).
For bpmd before r: allow a best-effort placeholder that just records the intended breakpoint, then on first runtime-detected event perform ensure + real placement (you seem already partway there).
Guard double initialization:
InitManagedHosting already uses g_hostingInitialized; ensure GetHostForSos() never triggers new hosting if null (just returns nullptr).
Optional diagnostic:
Add trace lines distinguishing “host not yet initialized (returning null)” vs “initializing managed hosting now”.
Advantages:

Prevents early host creation → no premature 0x80004002 confusion.
Eliminates re-entrancy / duplicate HostServices.Initialize assertion.
Lets you experiment whether the DAC hang only manifests before/after hosting side-effects.
Experimental matrix you can run after patch: A. Host deferred (new behavior) + DAC call before EnsureManagedHosting → expect hang (baseline). B. Host deferred + call EnsureManagedHosting immediately after runtime appears, then DAC call → compare hang/no-hang. C. Reintroduce previous eager hosting to confirm 0x80004002 path reproducibility (control).

If you want, I can implement the GetHost() change plus a new exported function now. Let me know and I’ll patch both native file and sketch Python integration.

Summary of difference vs LLDB:

LLDB on Linux relies on plugin-supplied host; does not trigger InitializeHosting in GetHost path.
Your GDB plugin forces InitializeHosting early on PAL, shifting timing and masking the hang while causing missing-runtime (E_NOINTERFACE) errors when used before target start.
Next options (tell me which you prefer):

Patch now with deferred GetHost + new EnsureManagedHosting export.
Add only safety guard (skip InitializeHosting if no runtime loaded yet by checking for libcoreclr mapping through debugger services).
Instrument current InitializeHosting path to log each stage to correlate with hang/failure.
Reply with 1, 2, or 3 (or custom), and I’ll proceed.
