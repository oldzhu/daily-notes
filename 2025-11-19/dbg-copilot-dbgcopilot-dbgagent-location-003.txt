I saw dbgcopilot package already include dbgagent and dbgweb, but if only pip install dist/dbgcopilot-*.whl, then I can run dbgagent and uvicorn dbgweb.app.main:app --reload but would fail to run dbgagent as the below:
(.venv) root ➜ /workspace (main) $ dbgagent
bash: /workspace/.venv/bin/dbgagent: No such file or directory
do I have to build whl for dbgagent separately in order to run dbgagent if not using local editable location?

========

Thanks for flagging that—here’s the short plan before the explanation:

Confirm how the packages are split and which wheel carries the dbgagent entry point.
Explain why installing only dbgcopilot isn’t enough for the CLI and what artifacts you still need.
Give the commands to build/install the dbgagent wheel so the dbgagent script appears.
Explanation

dbgcopilot is the shared backend/core package; its wheel contains the dbgcopilot library (and dbgweb, which can be started with uvicorn because it’s just a FastAPI application inside that package).
dbgagent is defined as a separate project in pyproject.toml, with its own project.scripts entry (dbgagent = "dbgagent.cli:main"). That means the console script is only generated when you install the dbgagent package itself—not simply when you install dbgcopilot.
That’s why your pip show dbgagent reports an “Editable project location”: the CLI currently exists only because you installed dbgagent in editable mode (pip install -e src/dbgagent). Without that, /workspace/.venv/bin/dbgagent won’t be created.
What to do

Build both wheels so you have the artifacts:

cd /workspacepython -m build                      # builds dist/dbgcopilot-*.whlcd src/dbgagentpython -m build                      # builds dist/dbgagent-*.whl
Install the published artifacts (replace <version> accordingly):

pip uninstall dbgcopilot dbgagentpip install ../dist/dbgcopilot-<version>-py3-none-any.whlpip install dist/dbgagent-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
After reinstalling, pip show dbgagent should no longer show “Editable project location”, and /workspace/.venv/bin/dbgagent will exist so the CLI works directly.
This let you keep dbgcopilot as the shared backend while shipping the dbgagent CLI in its own wheel for end users who don’t need the editable source tree.


Exactly—dbgcopilot and dbgagent are separate packages, so the published artifacts are two wheels:

dbgcopilot-<version>.whl contains the shared backends, REPL entry points (dbgcopilot, dbgcopilot-gdb, etc.), and dbgweb.
dbgagent-<version>.whl produces the dbgagent console script, because dbgcopilot doesn’t declare that entry point.
For end users you’ll therefore publish both wheels (and, if desired, dbgweb as its own wheel if you ever split it out). To make life easier for installers:


pip install dbgcopilot==<version>pip install dbgagent==<version>
Or, when shipping prerelease assets via GitHub, upload both dist/dbgcopilot-*.whl and src/dbgagent/dist/dbgagent-*.whl so they can pip-install each wheel directly.
