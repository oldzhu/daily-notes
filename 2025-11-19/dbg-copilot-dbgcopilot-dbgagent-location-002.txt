see above and let me know where dbgcopilot and dbgagent coming from?
=========

dbgcopilot is coming from the installed wheel: pip show reports its Location inside the venv’s site-packages and there is no Editable project location, so it’s the published artifact you installed via pip install dbgcopilot-*.whl.

dbgagent, however, is currently installed in editable mode—the pip show output includes Editable project location: /workspace/src/dbgagent, which means the console script is pointing at the local source tree instead of a built wheel. You can also look for dbgagent.egg-link in site-packages; its contents will point to dbgagent.

If you want both packages coming from wheels, reinstall them from dist (after running python -m build) with:


pip uninstall dbgcopilot dbgagentpip install dist/dbgcopilot-*.whlpip install dist/dbgagent-*.whl   # only if you build dbgagent separately
That removes the editable linkage and ensures everything comes from wheel installs.
