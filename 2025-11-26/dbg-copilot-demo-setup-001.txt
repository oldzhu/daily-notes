Look at the page https://github.com/plasma-umass/ChatDBG, you could see the home pages containes 3 embeded svg images for demo, if u click on them, it will redirect to asciinema demo pages which have the 3 uploaded asciinema cast files and you can see the demo in the redirect page.
Actually I reccorded 7 cast files for our demo.

now I am think the two ways to show these demo from home page

like the https://github.com/plasma-umass/ChatDBG, create svg image for these cats files and embeded the svgs in home pages which click link to uploaded asciineme demo casts
convert these cast into gifs and then like the https://github.com/plasma-umass/ChatDBG, create svg image for these gifs, embeded the svgs in home pages which click link to the convrted gifs.
Do you think which one is better? pros and cons. Do you have any other ideas for demo in our repo home page?

==========
No files touched here—answering from the README/UX side.

Embedding the asciinema casts via SVG tiles (option 1) keeps the demos lightweight and interactive; clicking opens the hosted cast page so folks can scrub through the real terminal output and see playback controls. The pros: no conversion work, the cast stays exact, and asciinema handles streaming/hosting. Con: visitors leave the repo page for the demo viewer and need an internet connection to asciinema; the preview tile is static (unless you rig an animated SVG preview).

Converting to GIFs (option 2) keeps everything in-repo—you can show animated previews right on the GitHub landing page and link to the GIFs (or host them elsewhere). The pros: instant, inline motion without extra clicks. Cons: GIFs are larger, lose terminal fidelity (colors/legibility and no interactivity), and you still need to host them somewhere (GitHub raw, GitHub Pages, S3, etc.).

Another idea: keep the SVG tiles but add a short descriptive caption (debugger name + goal) and a “Play demo” button that points to a dedicated Markdown page or section where you embed the cast (via asciinema’s iframe) and maybe summarize what was shown. That keeps the landing page lean while still offering follow-through detail.
