do we really need summary or new session when max_context_chars reached?

=======
Bumped the default max_context_chars in defaults.py from 16,000 to 4096 * 1024 (4,194,304) so the summary/new-session heuristics effectively stay dormant until those features are implemented.
Committed the change as Increase default max_context_chars.
No tests were run (not requested). If you’d like to push this into a release candidate, rerun your test suite or smoke tests in the dev image before packaging.A

You’re right that no code change is strictly needed: CopilotOrchestrator pulls max_context_chars from the prompt config, and we already bumped the built-in default in defaults.py to 4096 * 1024. So even though the inline fallback still says 16000, it will never be hit unless someone explicitly clears the prompt config entry.
If you want to keep the fallback aligned (and avoid future confusion), we could also change that 16000 literal to the same large number or even pull it from DEFAULT_PROMPT_CONFIG instead. Let me know if you’d like me to make that tidy-up as well.

let use keep fallback aligned and pull it from DEFAULT_PROMPT_CONFIG.
