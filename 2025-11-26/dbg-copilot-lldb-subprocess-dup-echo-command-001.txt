when tested dbgweb with lldb subprocess backend, could see the below

(lldb) run
[7Grun
Process 3859 launched: '/home/oldzhu/dbgcopilot/examples/bin/c/crash' (x86_64)
.....

(lldb)

(lldb) list crash.c:1,10
[7Glist crash.c:1,10

actually when tested dbgcoplot repl with lldb subprocess backend, could see the similar
copilot> /use lldb
Using LLDB (subprocess backend).
copilot> /exec file examples/bin/c/crash
(lldb) file examples/bin/c/crash
file examples/bin/c/crash
Current executable set to '/workspace/examples/bin/c/crash' (x86_64).

But gdb subproess has no such probem:

copilot> /use gdb
Using GDB (subprocess backend).
copilot> /exec file examples/bin/c/crash
(gdb) file examples/bin/c/crash

Reading symbols from examples/bin/c/crash...

I mean when tested with lldb subprocess backend, could see additional dulicate executed command with unprintable character pretended, we need to fix this
========

LLDB subprocess output now strips ANSI sequences before checking for the echoed command so duplicates like [7Grun/[7Glist… are removed from the captured text, matching what GDB already does.
The sanitized lines are also fully cleaned of ANSI codes before being returned, so dbgweb/repl no longer see the spurious control characters.
No automated tests were run (not requested). Please rerun your LLDB subprocess scenario to confirm the prompt echoes are gone.
