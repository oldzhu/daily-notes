Thanks I tested the soshelp and help and so far no errors. I would like you help to add traces and trace categories help so I can trace how soshelp and help so works in our code and what generated items used or fallback or any merge when turn on help trace category.

===============

Nice—let’s add targeted tracing so you can see exactly how help and soshelp flow, what generated data is used, and when we fall back.

Here’s what I changed and how to use it:

New trace categories

help: traces the help/soshelp flow and which path was taken (managed vs static), which static block was used, and per-command matching/fallback.
gen: traces generated help detection and export merging.
Where traces were added

sos.py
On help/soshelp invoke:
Logs request name/args, whether runtime is loaded, and return codes from bridge/libsos managed dispatch; logs when falling back to static help.
In static help printer:
Logs whether the generated static block or the baked one is used.
Logs per-command lookup matches and fallbacks.
Logs how many extra COMMAND_HELP lines were printed after the static block.
On generated exports merge:
Logs count of generated exports available and when merged.
tracing.py
Help text now mentions common categories: help, gen, bpmd, read, write.
How to turn it on

In GDB:
sostrace on help,gen
Then run:
help sos
soshelp
soshelp <cmd>
You’ll see lines like:
[help] request: name='soshelp' args=''
[help] runtime loaded: attempting managed help via bridge/libsos
[help] bridge DispatchManagedCommand => 0x00000000
[help] using generated static block (… lines)
[help] matched static entry for token='dumpheap'
[help] printed static block + N extra COMMAND_HELP entries
[gen] generated exports available: 2
[gen] merged generated exports into MANUAL_EXPORTS
Notes

Nothing else changes at runtime unless you enable tracing.
Categories are scoped; if you want everything, use sostrace on with no arguments.
If you want more granularity (e.g., which COMMAND_HELP entries came from generated vs baked), I can tag those during the merge and include that in the traces.
