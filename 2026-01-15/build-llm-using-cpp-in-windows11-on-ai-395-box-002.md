BpeTokenizer is now fully integrated and tested via the CLI (--tokenizer bpe, --bpe-vocab, --bpe-merges). The documentation in both English and Simplified Chinese READMEs has been updated to reflect the new tokenizer options and usage.

Let me know if you want to add more tests, extend BPE features, or proceed to the next task.
