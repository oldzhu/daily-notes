Let us continue to work on clru for arm64. pls compare the related code in lldb plugin(how clru works in lldb plugin will be call back to lldb interface disassemble method or not) and our sos gdb, analyze and give advices/solutions but hold on the code change beofer I review and confirm.

==============

Got it—let’s compare how clru works in LLDB vs our GDB plugin, explain why ARM64 output is wrong in GDB, and propose fixes to review (no code changes yet).

How clru works under LLDB vs GDB
SOS clru relies on the debugger host to:
Disassemble one instruction at a time via a host callback:
LLDB path: ILLDBServices::Disassemble
GDB path: our lldb_disassemble
Optionally map address → source line via:
LLDB/GDB: GetLineByOffset (we implement lldb_get_line_by_offset)
Flow (both hosts):
SOS calls Disassemble with an address and a size budget.
Host disassembles exactly one instruction, returns text and endOffset for the next instruction.
SOS loops until endOffset reaches “Begin + size”.
If source mapping is available, SOS prints “file @ line:” headers between blocks.
Conclusion: Yes, clru calls back to the host disassemble method repeatedly, and the host must return a correct “next address” (endOffset). If endOffset is wrong, the rest of the output will be garbage.

Why LLDB output looks correct and GDB output doesn’t
Your LLDB output shows proper AArch64 decoding and alignment:

First instruction: stp x29,x30,[sp,#-0x10]! with bytes “fd7bbfa9”
Subsequent lines aligned by +4 bytes
The GDB output is misaligned right after the first instruction:

First line shows a “fd” byte then “stp …” (bytes column is only one byte)
All following lines are at +1 byte increments, producing .inst 0x... (GDB is trying to decode misaligned words)
Root causes in our GDB implementation:

Instruction length mis-detection on ARM64
We try to infer instruction length by parsing addresses from “x/2i” output. On AArch64, GDB often prints addresses with “<+offset>” decorations, which break our naive parse. When parsing fails, we leave adv=1 (default), so SOS keeps asking us to decode at addr+1, addr+2…, which is wrong for fixed-length A64 instructions (4 bytes).
This also causes our “bytes” column to read 1 byte (“fd”) instead of 4 (“fd7bbfa9”/“a9bf7bfd” depending on display order).
x86-only disassembly flavor switching
We try to switch to “intel” flavor for readability, which is x86-only. On ARM64 this either no-ops or can introduce oddities—better to avoid flavor toggling on non-x86.
Byte ordering presentation
LLDB shows the A64 instruction bytes as a 32-bit word in big-endian display (“fd7bbfa9”), while raw memory is little-endian (“a9 bf 7b fd”). Our byte printing should choose a consistent, readable presentation; mismatches are cosmetic but can confuse comparisons.
Suggested fixes (hold changes; for your review)
Priority fixes:

Always use a correct instruction length on ARM64:
If machine type is ARM64, set adv=4 unconditionally. Do not rely on parsing GDB output to compute length.
Still read text from “x/1i <addr>” so GDB decodes the right mnemonic/operands.
Don’t toggle disassembly flavor on non-x86:
Wrap the “intel/att” flavor logic with a guard for x86/x64 only; skip entirely on ARM64.
Make address parsing more robust (even if we set adv=4):
When parsing “x/2i” lines (if we still use them), extract the first 0xHEX at line start via regex and ignore any “<...>” decorations. This helps for x64 too.
Nice-to-have polish:

Bytes column for ARM64:
Read exactly 4 bytes for adv=4.
Consider presenting the 4-byte word in big-endian hex (“fd7bbfa9”) to match LLDB. Make it configurable via an env var, e.g. SOS_GDB_DISASM_WORD_ENDIAN=be|le (default be to match LLDB output).
If we want to be minimal, we can disable the bytes column on ARM64 by default and allow enabling via SOS_GDB_DISASM_BYTES=1.
Skip x64-specific tweaks on ARM64:
Disable RIP canonicalization on ARM64 (it’s x64-only).
Expected outcome after fixes
clru on ARM64 disassembles in 4-byte steps and matches LLDB mnemonics and alignment.
No more .inst spam from misaligned decode.
Bytes column shows 4-byte words consistently; optionally matches LLDB’s display order.
Quick validation plan (no code yet)
On ARM64 target:
Run GDB “x/2i 0x<addr>” and confirm GDB itself shows proper mnemonics at +4 increments.
With adjusted logic (adv=4), run clru on the same address; confirm lines advance by +4 and mnemonics match the raw GDB output.
Verify source headers still print (we already implemented lldb_get_line_by_offset).
Summary of concrete changes to implement (after your go-ahead)
In lldb_disassemble:
Detect arch. If ARM64 → set adv=4; skip “disassembly-flavor” switching; disable RIP canonicalization.
Compute bytes_str by reading adv bytes (4); optionally reverse for display based on an env flag (default to LLDB-like big-endian 32-bit word).
Keep existing formatting and column alignment.
Optional: switch to GDB’s Python disassemble API if available (e.g., frame.architecture().disassemble(start, end)), which returns size fields per instruction and avoids string parsing entirely. If we do this, we can use the returned instruction size instead of hardcoding 4. However, the adv=4 fix is simpler and sufficient for ARM64.
If this approach looks good, I’ll implement the guarded ARM64 path (adv=4, no flavor toggle, stable bytes display) and keep x64 behavior unchanged.
