I’ll search for any remaining references to "artifacts/bin/current", creation of "current" symlinks, and SOS_ROOT to update them consistently.

Searched text for artifacts/bin/current|/current\b|SOS_ROOT|DIAGNOSTICS_ROOT|ln -sfn ".*current", 20 results

I’ll remove “current” symlink usage consistently across scripts and default to arch-specific Release paths, then summarize what I changed and propose commit messages.

Actions taken
post-start.sh

Removed diagnostics and bridge “current” symlink creation (left as commented with rationale).
SOS_ROOT now defaults to arch-specific Release, with override support:
export SOS_ROOT="${SOS_ROOT:-${DIAGNOSTICS_ROOT}/artifacts/bin/linux.${ARCH}.Release}"
build.sh

Removed updates to artifacts/bin/current for diagnostics and bridge (added comments to prefer explicit linux.<arch>.<config>).
No functional change to build outputs; only symlink side-effect removed.
test.sh

SOS_ROOT now defaults to arch-specific Release, overridable:
export SOS_ROOT="${SOS_ROOT:-${REPO_ROOT}/src/diagnostics/artifacts/bin/linux.${ARCH}.Release}"
Plugin path detection already tries linux.

ARCH.{CONFIG}, then Debug, then Release (so it still finds a plugin if present).
test_gdbsos.py

Default plugin discovery updated to be arch-aware:
Tries linux.<arch>.Debug then linux.<arch>.Release under top-level artifacts.
Removed fallback to diagnostics/artifacts/bin/current.
Verified no remaining “current” symlink creation in scripts; only .dotnet toolset symlinks remain (they’re per-arch and safe to keep).

What’s left referencing “current”
A generated/test artifact appears under sos.py (not a script we maintain). I didn’t touch it.
Documentation references (e.g., README, docs/faq.md) mention “current” historically; not modified since your ask was specifically for scripts.
Commit message options
Option A (single)

Subject: scripts: drop ‘current’ symlink; default to arch Release
Body:
Remove artifacts/bin/current symlink creation in build.sh and post-start.sh
Default SOS_ROOT to linux.${ARCH}.Release (overridable via env)
tests: arch-aware default plugin path; no dependency on diagnostics/bin/current
Option B (split)

devcontainer: stop creating diagnostics/bridge ‘current’ symlinks; SOS_ROOT -> linux.${ARCH}.Release
build: remove artifacts/bin/current updates; prefer explicit linux.<arch>.<config>
tests: default SOS_ROOT to arch Release; plugin path arch-aware (Debug/Release)
If you want, I can also sweep docs to remove “current” references or add a short note explaining the new convention.
