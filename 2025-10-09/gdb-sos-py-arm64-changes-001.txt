Details by area
Architecture detection and processor type
_detect_arch_name():
More robust handling of gdb.Frame.architecture().name being a method or attribute, decoding bytes, filtering bogus reprs, and returning a clean, lower-cased name.
Added trace logging at each detection step:
frame.architecture().name()
show architecture fallback
os.uname().machine
_detect_machine_type():
New environment overrides: SOS_FORCE_MACHINE_TYPE or SOS_FORCE_ARCH with values like arm64|aarch64|amd64|x64|x86_64|x86-64.
More explicit mapping from detected arch name to IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE constants with trace logs for:
Override decisions
Name-based matches
Pointer-size fallback
Final default
_detect_pointer_size():
Tries GDB type system first, then ctypes, logs the source and value for easier diagnostics.
lldb_get_processor_type():
Now logs both the detected arch name and the resulting machine type (e.g., ARM64 vs AMD64) for transparency.
Impact:

Clearer, debuggable architecture selection; easy to force via env for troubleshooting.
Avoids “always x64” behavior and aligns with LLDB semantics.
Thread context (DT_CONTEXT) population
New helper: _fill_arm64_dt_context(frame, contextFlags, context_ptr):
Writes a minimal-but-sufficient ARM64 DT_CONTEXT subset: ContextFlags, Cpsr, X0–X28, Fp(x29), Lr(x30), Sp, Pc, with register fallbacks (e.g., pstate for CPSR, fp for x29, lr for x30).
Matches offsets used by LLDB’s DT_CONTEXT layout so SOS can consume it.
lldb_get_thread_context_by_system_id(...):
AMD64 path unchanged (uses _fill_amd64_dt_context).
ARM64 path now sets flags (CONTEXT_ARM64 | CONTROL | INTEGER) and fully populates DT_CONTEXT via _fill_arm64_dt_context.
Updates a small per-thread cache {rip, rsp, rbp} using cross-arch register names (rip|pc, rsp|sp, rbp|fp|x29).
Returns success (S_OK) for both AMD64 and ARM64.
Impact:

Unblocked ARM64 SOS flows like clrstack and dso by providing the expected context structure, aligning with LLDB behavior.
Value queries and stack bounds
lldb_get_value_by_name(...):
Implemented (was E_NOTIMPL before).
Supports:
pc aliases: $pc, pc, instructionoffset, ip
sp aliases: $sp, sp, stackoffset
Stack bounds (via /proc/<pid>/maps scanning for mapping containing SP):
Top: stackbase, threadstackbase, stackhigh, stack_top, stack_top_addr
Bottom: stacklimit, threadstacklimit, stacklow, stack_bottom, stack_bottom_addr
Ensures we read registers on the correct thread (switch if needed), then uses gdb.newest_frame() with cross-arch fallbacks.
Impact:

SOS can retrieve stack base/limit and register-derived values reliably across x64/arm64.
Instruction/stack/frame offsets
lldb_get_instruction_offset(...), lldb_get_stack_offset(...), lldb_get_frame_offset(...):
Now switch to the current thread sysid (if tracked) before reading registers directly.
Prefer values from _context_cache and fall back to live register reads with cross-arch names.
Impact:

More stable offset retrieval in multi-thread scenarios and across architectures.
Context stack trace behavior
lldb_get_context_stack_trace(...):
Now returns S_OK with framesFilled = 0 instead of E_NOTIMPL.
This lets SOS fallback cleanly to its own unwinder without treating it as a hard failure.
Impact:

Smoother behavior in commands that probe for a native stack-trace provider first.
QEMU test harness docs
README.md:
Added guidance to disable W^X for JIT to ensure bpmd/JIT breakpoints work reliably:
export DOTNET_EnableWriteXorExecute=0
Impact:

Fewer surprises when testing breakpoints in the ARM64 VM environment; avoids JIT write/execute protection interfering with bpmd.
Behavioral overview
ARM64 now reports correctly as ARM64 and provides a fully populated DT_CONTEXT for SOS consumers.
clrstack and dso work on ARM64 per your confirmation.
Value lookups for IP/SP and stack bounds are available and robust on both x64 and arm64.
Offset getters are thread-aware and more consistent.
Diagnostics are richer with targeted trace logs for architecture detection and processor type reporting.
QEMU test README includes a practical W^X hint to avoid breakpoint issues.
If you want, I can fold these highlights into a short CHANGELOG entry or add a “What’s new” section to README.md to document these improvements for future contributors.
