Nice call—separating logs per-arch avoids clobbering. I updated both test harnesses to write under arch-specific subfolders.

Changes
test.sh

Logs now go to logs/${ARCH} after mapping uname -m to our ARCH label:
x64 → logs/x64
arm64 → logs/arm64
The log directory is created before running tests.
test_gdbsos.py

Default --logdir now resolves to logs/<arch> (same mapping, overridable via CLI).
Still allows callers to pass a custom --logdir if needed.
No other behavior changed.

Commit message
tests: write logs to arch-specific dirs (logs/x64, logs/arm64)
test.sh: LOGDIR=logs/${ARCH}
test_gdbsos.py: default --logdir to logs/<arch> (overridable)
If you’d like, I can also add a quick cleanup script to prune old logs per-arch, or time-stamp subfolders for repeated runs.
