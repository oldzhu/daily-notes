 reviewed the document for install.md and pulishing.md, and root readme.md, I still we are lacking the detailed document on how our end users can downloda, use and test our dbgcopilot and dbgagent
in publishing.md, we described 3 ways to publish the tool

pip package
docker hub image
clone the repo and test in dev container
in install.md, the the steps more like for build and install in dev container for dev(no cloneand step and reopn in container step), but no steps for install from github pip package.
What I wan to is install.md focus on end users to download/install/test view, I mean it is for end users install/test but not for dev of the project to build/test.
=============
pls also add the below two to install.md which are about how end users use and test the tool in other 2 ways.

the holder section for download/test docker image release although publish the docker image yet.
the section for clone the project and reopen it in dev container, build/install(can also in editable location)/test
which means totally install.md contains all 3ways how user can use/test the tool
================

Updated the user-facing install guide so it now centers on the three supported ways to consume the release artifacts:

Added a detailed end-user workflow in install.md for installing the published wheels (or prerelease GitHub artifacts), verifying the commands, and starting dbgcopilot, dbgagent, or the FastAPI dashboard.
Added new sections covering the Docker image path and the dev-container flow (clone → open in Remote-Containers → rebuild/install/test), so the doc now documents the full set of delivery/testing options.
Adjusted README.md to point the “Installation & Testing” link at the new doc.
No automated tests were run (docs-only).
