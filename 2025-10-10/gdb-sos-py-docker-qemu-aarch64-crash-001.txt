seems the following docker compose could not fix the old qemu-aarch64 crash

services:
  binfmt:
    image: tonistiigi/binfmt:latest
    privileged: true
    command: ["--install", "arm64"]
    restart: "no"
...
 dev-arm64:
    build:
      context: ..
      dockerfile: .devcontainer/Dockerfile
      args:
        VARIANT: "8.0-jammy"
    platform: linux/arm64
    volumes:
      - ..:/workspaces/gdbsos:cached
    working_dir: /workspaces/gdbsos
    user: vscode
    privileged: true
    tty: true
    command: sleep infinity
    depends_on:
      binfmt:
        condition: service_completed_successfully
    environment: {}
...
the command docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt:latest --install arm64

and the command docker compose run --rm binfmt with the below compose yml

services:

  binfmt:

    image: tonistiigi/binfmt:latest

    privileged: true

    command: ["--install", "arm64"]

    restart: "no"



doing exactly the same thing and has exactly effect to host and containers?
===========


Yes, for the specific task of installing the arm64 binfmt emulator on the host system using the tonistiigi/binfmt:latest image, the two commands have the same essential effect on the host.

Here is a breakdown of why:

1. Equivalent Functionality for this Specific Task
The Goal: The primary purpose of running the tonistiigi/binfmt container with the --install arm64 command and the --privileged flag is to register QEMU as a binfmt_misc handler in the Linux kernel of the Docker host machine. This allows the host to run arm64 binaries (and therefore arm64 containers) transparently, even if the host's native architecture is different (e.g., amd64).

The Key Components:

--privileged / privileged: true: This is crucial. It gives the container root access to the host machine's kernel capabilities, which is required to modify the /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/ directory on the host and install the emulator.

--rm / docker compose run default: The docker run command uses --rm to remove the container after it exits. The docker compose run command also defaults to a "one-off" execution and should clean up the container when it's done.

tonistiigi/binfmt:latest: The image is the same.

--install arm64 / command: ["--install", "arm64"]: The command passed to the image's entrypoint is identical.

Because this container is intentionally designed to modify the host kernel and then immediately exit, both the docker run and docker compose run versions, with the necessary equivalent flags/parameters, achieve this effect on the host.

2. Minor Technical Differences (that don't affect the host configuration)
While the effect on the host's binfmt configuration is the same, there are some minor technical differences inherent to docker run vs. docker compose run:

Feature	docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt:latest --install arm64	docker compose run --rm binfmt
Networking	By default, uses the default bridge network (docker0).	By default, creates a user-defined network for the project (e.g., directoryname_default) and connects the container to it.
Container Naming	A random name will be generated for the container before it is removed.	The container will be named using the project name and service name (e.g., directoryname_binfmt_run_#).
Dependencies	Does not implicitly manage other containers.	If the binfmt service had a depends_on definition, Docker Compose would start those dependencies first (though none are defined here).

In the context of installing a host-level kernel feature like a binfmt emulator, these differences in container-specific networking and naming are generally irrelevant to the final outcome of the host's binfmt configuration.
