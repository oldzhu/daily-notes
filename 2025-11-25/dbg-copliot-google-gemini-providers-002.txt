Added _merge_default_providers in providers.py and updated _load_config so the installer now injects any built-in defaults (like gemini) when an existing llm_providers.json is missing them; the config file is rewriten once with the merged defaults so future installs keep the same list.
This ensures /llm list and dbgweb see the same providers even after you’ve already created a per-environment config file (no need to delete the old JSON by hand).
No automated tests were run (not requested). Please reinstall the updated wheel or run from the repo, then check dbgcopilot /llm list and uvicorn dbgweb.app.main:app --reload to confirm gemini now appears without manual config edits.
