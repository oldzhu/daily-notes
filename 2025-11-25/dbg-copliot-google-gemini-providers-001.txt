the openapi compitible base url and path are not correct for google gemini provide, please refer the following code,I copied from the google document page:
curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/chat/completions" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer GEMINI_API_KEY" \
-d '{
    "model": "gemini-2.5-flash",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain to me how AI works"}
    ]
    }'
 I would like the default model for google gemini provider is gemini-2.5-flash, pols modify the changes accordingly.
 In addition, I know the modles list supported by google llm provider can be get from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/models but it require authroziation header, which means we only can get the list once we set the api-key, pls also note and code accordingly. 
=======
Added the Google Gemini entry to providers.py so it appears in /llm list with the OpenAI-compatible endpoint (https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/chat/completions) and defaults to gemini-2.5-flash.
Updated openai_compat.py so list_models switches to Gemini’s /v1beta/openai/models path (which also requires the Authorization header derived from the configured API key) before falling back to the usual /v1/models path.
Documented the new provider in llm.md, noting the endpoint/model defaults and reminding users that listing models needs the Gemini API key.
Tests: not run (not requested).
=========
base_url is https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai
and path is /chat/completions

=======
Added a gemini entry to the default provider registry that points at https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai with /chat/completions, defaults to gemini-2.5-flash, and exposes the same OpenAI-compatible capability list as the other vendors.
Tweaked the OpenAI-compatible helper so list_models hits <base_url>/models for Gemini (rather than hardcoding /v1beta/openai twice) and still uses the configured Authorization header, meaning the provider only returns Gemini’s model list once you’ve supplied the API key.
Documented the provider in llm.md, updating the summary of defaults and noting that model listing requires the same Authorization header/API key.
Next step: run copilot> /llm use gemini and set the API key (/llm key gemini …), then confirm /llm list works and /exec commands still behave with the new provider.

===

- Added the `gemini` definition to llm_providers.json (OpenAI-compatible base/path, `gemini-2.5-flash`, `supports_model_list`) so `/llm list`/`/llm use gemini` now have a built-in provider entry instead of being unknown.
- Clarified llm.md so the convenience-alias list now names `gemini` alongside the other configured endpoints and calls out that `/models` needs the same API key before running `/llm list`.

No automated tests were run (not requested). Please reload or restart the REPL, set your Gemini API key, and run `/llm list` plus `/llm use gemini` to confirm everything appears as expected; ensure the key is set before listing models.


====
Trimmed the gemini description in both llm_providers.json and the source default in providers.py so /llm list now shows Google Gemini OpenAI-compatible API without the extra text you found too verbose.
Nothing else changed; docs and behavior remain the same.
Let me know if you also want to rephrase the doc snippet or adjust any messaging for /llm use output.
