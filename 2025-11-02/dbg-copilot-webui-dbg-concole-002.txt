Terminal Upgrade

Swapped the debugger pane to xterm.js via CDN in index.html, plus the fit addon so the pane stretches with the resizable layout.
Replaced the old console logic in app.js with a live terminal bridge: keystrokes flow through xterm to the existing /command API, WebSocket output streams straight into the terminal, and pane resizes trigger automatic re-fit. Blank ENTER now refreshes the prompt, and status lines land inside the terminal.
Refreshed styles.css for the new terminal surface, keeping it flex-based with the draggable dividers while preserving the explorer/chat styling.
Pushed an initial prompt into each new session by running an empty command in session_manager.py, so the terminal shows (gdb) (or (lldb)) right after creation.
Heads-up: history navigation, inline editing, and Ctrl+C/interrupt handling are still pending—we’ll tackle those next. Restart the uvicorn dev server so the static asset changes and CDN scripts load cleanly.

Next steps if you want to keep momentum:

Layer in command history + cursor navigation inside the terminal.
Teach the backend to accept interrupts/streaming input for Ctrl+C-style control.

=========

tested and I can see new screen, but I would like to u work on the below things besides continue working debugger console shell next work items.

move llm related settings such llm provider, llm models, llm key from explorer frame to chat frame.
put chat box and send button to the bottom position of the chat frame, put send buttom, llm settngs below the chat box.
the UI items in explorer frame are not fit weil within explorer frame screen and are out of the explorer frame screen.
==========

UI Adjustments

Moved the LLM provider/model/key controls from the explorer session form into chat-settings inside index.html, leaving the explorer focused on debugger/program setup.
Anchored the chat input stack at the bottom of the chat pane: textarea first, then the Send button, followed by the relocated LLM settings; added chat-controls to keep the button right-aligned.
Reworked styles.css: styled the new chat-settings group, ensured the bottom stack hugs the frame edge, restored all terminal styling, and allowed the explorer pane to scroll vertically so its controls never overflow.
No JS changes were required; existing IDs still point to the relocated controls and session creation keeps using them.
Give the dev server a quick restart (uvicorn dbgweb.app.main:app --reload) to pick up the updated layout, then verify the explorer form scrolls cleanly and the chat pane layout matches expectations.
