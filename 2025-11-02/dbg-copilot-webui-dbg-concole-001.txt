Hello I am back, I have new idea about debugger console frame UI. I want debugger frame provide the similar experience as run gdb/lldb in console sehll. If u didnot capture what I mean, just ask and I will clarify more.

==========

Great to have you back! When you say “similar experience as running gdb/lldb in a console shell,” what aspects are you after? For example:

Full-screen terminal look-and-feel (prompt, colors, scrollback)?
Command history with arrow keys?
Inline editing, tab completion, or ANSI color support?
Multi-line command handling or pager behavior?
Let me know which pieces matter most and we can scope the changes accordingly.

==========
it would be better if we provide the full experience as run gdb/lldb in console shell so all 4 u metioned as examples are what I want if it is feasible, but we can do them 1 by 1 and implement the most impotarnt ones gradually.

=======

Let’s stage the console upgrade in a few focused passes so we always have something usable:

Pass 1 – Terminal foundation

Swap the debugger pane to an embedded terminal component (xterm.js is the usual choice) so we get a real terminal surface, proper prompt rendering, ANSI colors, and smooth scrollback.
Bridge the existing WebSocket stream into xterm.js and send keystrokes back to the backend; make sure we preserve the current queue plumbing so nothing else breaks.
Pass 2 – Command handling polish

Implement history navigation (↑/↓), inline editing, and submission semantics that mirror gdb/lldb.
Support multi-line input and basic pager behavior (e.g., “–Type <return> to continue–”) so the experience feels authentic.
Pass 3 – Advanced niceties

Add tab completion, copy/paste shortcuts, maybe theme tweaks to match a real terminal.
Expose settings toggles (font size, color theme) so users can fine-tune their console feel.
I’d start with Pass 1 tomorrow unless you want to reorder the priorities—just say the word.
