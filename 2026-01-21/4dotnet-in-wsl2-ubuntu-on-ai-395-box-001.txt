Pushed successfully.

origin/next now exists at 19ceb75 (your working branch going forward).
origin/master was force-updated to 96e289c (the container build-env commit 709542e is no longer on master).
Backup still exists locally as master-backup-20260119 if you ever need to recover that old master tip.
Next: keep day-to-day work on next (and we can do the container smoke test tomorrow from that branch).
