You now have the new HF CLI installed and working via the Python 3.11 environment. The installed commands/modules are here:

hf (symlink/entrypoint): hf (this one was broken earlier because click was missing; we installed it).
huggingface_hub package: site-packages (version 1.2.1).
Working invocation (bypasses any stale shebangs): /bin/python3.11 -m huggingface_hub.cli.hf --help.
To use the CLI normally:

Ensure ~/.local/bin is on your PATH (add export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" to ~/.bashrc if needed), then run:

hf --help
If that ever fails, use the explicit module form:


/bin/python3.11 -m huggingface_hub.cli.hf --help
If you specifically need the legacy huggingface-cli name, reinstall with:


/bin/python3.11 -m pip install --user --upgrade "huggingface_hub[cli]"
and ensure ~/.local/bin is on PATH.
