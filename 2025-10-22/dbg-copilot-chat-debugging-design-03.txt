I’ll make sure your latest confirmation-first flow is built, installed, and ready for your GDB test and fix the nested ask() bug before you try it.

actions taken
Rebuilt and force-reinstalled the package so GDB picks up the latest code.
Fixed AgentOrchestrator.ask being accidentally nested inside get_prompt_config; it’s now a proper class method callable from the REPL.
Re-ran tests: all green.
Built the crash demo binary for quick testing.
Quality gates:

Build: PASS
Tests: PASS
Lint/Typecheck: not configured in this repo
how to try it in GDB
In a terminal, start GDB on the demo binary:
gdb -q examples/crash_demo/crash
Inside GDB, load and start the copilot REPL:
python import dbgcopilot.plugins.gdb.copilot_cmd
copilot
Optional: ensure updated prompts are active:
/prompts reload
Drive the confirmation-first flow:
Ask naturally (e.g., “load and run to the crash”).
The model should propose commands and ask you to confirm, without emitting <cmd>.
Reply to the model (e.g., “yes”).
After your confirmation, it should reply with only <cmd>…</cmd>.
The tool will execute immediately, echoing with “gdb> …” and printing raw output unmodified.
It will then send the fresh output back to the model once and show its next-step guidance (no local confirmation injected).
Useful REPL helpers:
/exec <gdb-cmd> runs a command with gdb> echo
/colors on|off toggles color (assistant and gdb> echoes only; GDB output remains raw)
/llm list and /llm use <name> to pick a provider
/prompts show|reload to inspect/refresh prompt config
/summary to view a session summary
Overflow reset controls (to avoid loops when context is large):

If prompted, reply with:
“summarize and new session” → starts a new session with an LLM-generated summary
“new session” → starts a fresh session without summary
notes
No commits were made; changes are only built and installed locally for your testing.
The REPL now executes only when the model emits <cmd>…</cmd>; there’s no local yes/no parsing and no duplicate confirmation.
Command echoes are consistently prefixed with “gdb> ”.
what’s next
You run through your GDB scenarios. If anything feels off (e.g., duplicate confirmations, missing gdb> echoes, overflow behavior), tell me what you saw, and I’ll iterate quickly.
Optional cleanup (post-validation): remove any now-unused local confirmation helpers/state.
