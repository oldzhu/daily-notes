Added a “things tried + results” record to docs/2026-01-10-issue3-repro-progress.md.

Captures the repeated host/guest sanity-check commands (ps/ss, SSH probes)
Records the scp-based staging flow for syz-execprog/syz-executor/repro.syz + the executor revision verification
Documents the exact syz-execprog invocation we used and how we tailed progress
Notes both observed failure modes:
Early KASAN panic when booting with 9p enabled (with grep/sed commands to extract the panic region from qemu-serial.log)
SSH “banner exchange” timeouts while serial continues (and the log-grep checks for the vhost hung-task signature)
Includes the QEMU restart sequence used between attempts and a note about BusyBox limitations
Want me to proceed now with the foreground (non-daemon) console run to prioritize capturing the vhost hung-task live (no SSH dependency)?
