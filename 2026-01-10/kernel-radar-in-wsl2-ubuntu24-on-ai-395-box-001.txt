What you can still do now (offline, inside the VM)

Keep dmesg running: dmesg -wT
If you can trigger any hangs manually, capture stacks:
echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger
echo w > /proc/sysrq-trigger
Save logs: dmesg -T | tail -n 400
Tomorrow plan (when network is stable)

Install/build syzkaller runner (syz-execprog + syz-executor) and make them available in the VM (either via shared folder or copying in).
Then run repro.syz and we’ll confirm reproduction by looking for the hung-task/vhost signatures in dmesg.
If you want, tell me whether you prefer “build on host + share into VM” (fast) or “build inside VM” (self-contained but slower).
