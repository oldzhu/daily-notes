Is this approach complex to implement? early in standalone.py import readline (standard on Linux/macOS) and call readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete") plus maintain history via readline.write_history_file() if desired. The existing input() call will then respect the arrow keys automatically.
if not, pls go ahead to implement

==========

Added readline-backed input history to standalone.py, including optional history persistence (~/.copilot_history), tab binding, and no-op behavior when readline isn’t available so arrow keys now recall previous commands.
Hooked the history setup before entering the REPL loop so the configuration runs once per session.
Tests not run (not requested).

===========
is readline builtin python module? or rquire additional install?

===========
On most Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS) the readline module ships with Python because the interpreter is built against the GNU readline library—so you can import it out of the box.
On Windows the stdlib doesn’t include GNU readline, so the import will fail unless you install a third-party package (e.g., pyreadline3 or prompt_toolkit) and adjust the code to fall back when readline isn’t available (which our changes already handle by checking for None).
