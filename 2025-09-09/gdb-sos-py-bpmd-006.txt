Great—looks like aligning to the native host runtime fixed the DAC hang on clrstack.

Quick sanity checklist to exercise more paths:

clrthreads, dumpstack/dso, ip2md/name2ee
dumpheap/verifyheap/gcroot/gcwhere on live run
bpmd end-to-end: set before CLR loads, confirm pending bp flush at coreclr load, break in managed method
dumpobj/dumpmt/dumpclass across multiple modules
eeversion/runtimes and module size/base via lldb2_get_module_info equivalents
Symbol flow: loadsymbols; ensure no unexpected re-entry into GDB during DAC work
Toggles for A/B:

Force legacy (Python) host path: SOS_GDB_USE_HOST=0
Legacy diagnostics only: SOS_GDB_DAC_CALL_INLINE=1, SOS_GDB_DAC_TIMEOUT_MS=2000
Tracing: sostrace on
If anything regresses, capture the hang point with sostrace and we’ll iterate.
