Those numbers are great for dual-boot: you have ~1.75 TB free on C: and ~1.79 TB free on D:.

For reference, your output is in bytes:

C: free ≈ 1.59 TiB, used ≈ 229 GiB
D: free ≈ 1.63 TiB, used ≈ 193 GiB
Recommended disk layout (best for LLVM/Triton + ROCm)
Goal: keep Windows intact, keep a shared NTFS drive, and give Ubuntu fast native ext4 space for builds (LLVM builds are disk-hungry and NTFS-in-Linux is slower).

Keep
C: Windows (NTFS) unchanged.
D: keep most of it as NTFS for shared data and Windows access.
Add (on D: ideally)
Create one new Linux partition by shrinking D::

Ubuntu root (/) on ext4: 250–400 GB (minimum I’d do is ~200 GB; comfortable is 300+ GB)
LLVM + MLIR + Clang builds can easily consume tens to >100 GB depending on build type, multiple build dirs, ccache, etc.
Optional but nice:
Separate home ext4: 200–500 GB (if you want cleaner separation)
Swap: you can skip a swap partition and use a swapfile later (simpler). If you want a partition: 16–32 GB is typical, more only if you expect hibernation.
This avoids formatting an entire disk: you only shrink D: and carve out ext4 space.

Can both Windows and Linux access both disks?
Linux can read/write NTFS (C: and D:), so Ubuntu can access your Windows files.
Windows cannot natively read ext4, so don’t put “shared” files only on ext4 if you need Windows access.
Best practice for performance:
Put LLVM/Triton source + build directories on ext4 (fast, correct permissions/symlinks).
Keep datasets, installers, documents, and “shared” stuff on NTFS (D:).
What about reusing the WSL2 distro rootfs / .vhdx?
You generally can’t practically “install Ubuntu using the WSL2 rootfs” as your native dual-boot OS.
The realistic path is:
Install Ubuntu normally (it will create a real ext4 filesystem + bootloader).
Then copy/migrate your repos and configs from WSL2 into native Ubuntu.
Dual-boot gotchas (worth checking now)
If BitLocker is on (especially for C: or D:), have recovery keys ready.
Disable Windows Fast Startup (prevents NTFS “hibernated volume” mount issues in Linux).
Secure Boot may complicate ROCm/kernel driver pieces depending on what’s needed; often easiest is disabling Secure Boot if you hit driver/module signing issues.
Next step
Tell me:

Is BitLocker enabled on C: or D:?
Roughly how much space do you want to allocate to Ubuntu (e.g. 300 GB vs 600 GB)?
Then I’ll propose an exact partition recipe (single ext4 vs split / + home) optimized for LLVM/Triton builds and ROCm.
