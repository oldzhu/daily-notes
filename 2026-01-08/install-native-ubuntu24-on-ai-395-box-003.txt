Below is a practical, safe “cookbook” for installing native Ubuntu 24.04 onto your D disk (Windows stays on C). I’ll keep it concrete and biased toward avoiding “wipe the wrong disk”.

A) Prepare the boot USB (Windows 11)
1) Download Ubuntu 24.04 LTS ISO
Get “Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Desktop” ISO from ubuntu.com.
2) Create the USB with Rufus (recommended)
Download Rufus (portable is fine).
Insert a USB drive (≥ 8GB).
In Rufus:
Device: your USB stick
Boot selection: select the Ubuntu ISO
Partition scheme: GPT
Target system: UEFI (non CSM)
File system: FAT32 (Rufus usually chooses correctly)
Click Start.
If asked ISO mode vs DD mode: choose ISO mode (default).
B) Pre-install safety checks (Windows)
3) Confirm which disk is Windows vs target disk
From your data:

Disk 0 (serial ends …4998) contains C: → DO NOT TOUCH
Disk 1 (serial ends …A451) contains D: → TARGET for Ubuntu
(Optional but safer)

4) Make D “Unallocated” (so it’s obvious in the installer)
In Disk Management:

Right-click the D: volume → Delete Volume
You should see Disk 1 become “Unallocated”
This makes it much harder to accidentally pick the wrong disk later.
C) Boot into the Ubuntu USB (UEFI)
5) Boot menu
Reboot and enter boot menu (often F12, Esc, F9, etc.)
Select the USB entry that explicitly says UEFI: <USB name>
Choose Try or Install Ubuntu
D) Identify the correct NVMe disk in the live environment (most important step)
6) In “Try Ubuntu”, open Terminal and map disks by serial
Run:

sudo nvme list
You should see two devices (both CT2000P310SSD8). Pick the one whose serial ends with:

A451 → this is your D disk (install here)
4998 → this is your C disk (Windows; do not touch)
(Backup command if needed)

lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,MODEL,SERIAL,TYPE,MOUNTPOINTS
E) Install Ubuntu onto D (manual partitioning = safest)
7) Start installer
Double-click Install Ubuntu.

8) Choose “Installation type” → Something else
This gives you explicit control and avoids wiping C.

9) Partition Disk D (the one matching serial …A451)
On the correct disk device (e.g. /dev/nvme1n1, but confirm by serial):

Delete any existing partitions on that disk (if any).
Create these partitions:
EFI System Partition

Size: 1024 MB
Type: FAT32
Mount point: /boot/efi
Flags: esp (some UIs call it “EFI System Partition”)
Root partition

Size: 300–400 GB
Type: ext4
Mount point: /
Home partition

Size: “rest of the disk”
Type: ext4
Mount point: home
Notes:

You can skip a swap partition; Ubuntu can use a swapfile later.
300–400GB for / is comfortable for LLVM/Triton builds + multiple build dirs + ccache.
10) Bootloader location
Set “Device for boot loader installation” to the same disk you’re installing Ubuntu onto (the disk with serial …A451), e.g. /dev/nvme1n1 (not a partition like /dev/nvme1n1p1).

11) Install
Proceed with timezone/user settings and install.

F) First boot and boot order
12) After install, reboot
Remove USB when prompted.
If it boots to Windows directly:
Enter BIOS and set ubuntu as first boot option, or use the one-time boot menu to select ubuntu.
Ubuntu’s GRUB menu should also let you boot Windows.
G) Post-install quick checks (before ROCm)
After first boot into Ubuntu:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
lspci | grep -i -E "vga|display|amd"
uname -a
When you reach this point, send me:

sudo nvme list output
lspci | grep -i -E "vga|display|amd" output
…and I’ll guide the ROCm setup and validation (rocminfo, basic HIP sample, then Triton/LLVM practice workflow).
