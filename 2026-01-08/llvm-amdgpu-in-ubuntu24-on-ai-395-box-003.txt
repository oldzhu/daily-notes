Here’s the safest, built-in way to move a WSL2 distro from D: to C: using export → unregister → import (this moves the ext4.vhdx contents). Do this per distro you care about.

0) Identify what you have
In PowerShell (Admin not required):

wsl -l -v
You’ll see names like Ubuntu-24.04, maybe also docker-desktop / docker-desktop-data (if you use Docker Desktop). Only move what you actually need.

1) Shut down WSL (important)

wsl --shutdown
Wait ~5 seconds.

2) Export the distro to a tar on C:
Pick a temp folder with lots of space, e.g. C:\wsl-backup:

mkdir C:\wsl-backup
Export (replace Ubuntu-24.04 with your distro name):

wsl --export Ubuntu-24.04 C:\wsl-backup\Ubuntu-24.04.tar
This can take a while.

3) Unregister the old distro (this removes the old VHDX on D:)
Double-check the .tar exists and is large (not 0 bytes), then:

wsl --unregister Ubuntu-24.04
This is the destructive step (it deletes the registered instance), so only do it after export succeeds.

4) Import it to C:
Choose a new install directory on C:, e.g. C:\WSL\Ubuntu-24.04:

mkdir C:\WSL\Ubuntu-24.04
wsl --import Ubuntu-24.04 C:\WSL\Ubuntu-24.04 C:\wsl-backup\Ubuntu-24.04.tar --version 2
5) Start it and verify your data

wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04
Check your home directory files are present.

6) Restore default user (common gotcha after import)
After --import, the default user is often root. Fix it inside WSL:

wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04 -u root
ls /home (see your username, e.g. oldzhu)
Edit wsl.conf (create if missing) to set default user:
sudo nano /etc/wsl.conf
Add:

[user]default=YOUR_USERNAME
Exit WSL, then:
wsl --shutdown
wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04
7) Repeat for other distros (if needed)
Run the same export/unregister/import for each distro you want to move.

Notes / pitfalls

If you use Docker Desktop: moving docker-desktop* distros is usually unnecessary and can break Docker; tell me if those appear in wsl -l -v and whether you use Docker.
Keep the .tar until you’ve booted the imported distro and confirmed everything is there. Then you can delete C:\wsl-backup\*.tar.
When you’re done, paste the output of wsl -l -v and confirm D: is now empty (or at least no longer hosting the WSL VHDX). Then I’ll give you the exact Ubuntu partitioning/install steps to use the full D: for native Linux + ROCm.- Exit WSL, then:

wsl --shutdown
wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04
