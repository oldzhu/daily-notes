Go with the single big root layout (no separate home). That’s the “never worry about partition sizing” choice.

Partition plan for D (simple + best for LLVM/Triton builds)
On the D disk (serial ends A451):

EFI System Partition
Size: 1024 MB
Type: FAT32
Mount point: /boot/efi
Flags: esp
Root partition
Size: rest of disk (all remaining space)
Type: ext4
Mount point: /
That’s it.

Notes:

You don’t need a home partition; home will just be a directory inside /.
Skip swap partition; Ubuntu will typically use a swapfile (or you can add one later).
Installer clicks (summary)
Boot Ubuntu USB in UEFI mode.
“Installation type” → Something else
Select the disk that matches serial …A451.
Delete partitions on that disk.
Create the two partitions above.
“Device for boot loader installation” → choose the same disk (e.g. /dev/nvme1n1, whatever corresponds to …A451).
After Ubuntu boots (first 3 commands)
Run:

df -h
lsblk -f
lspci | grep -i -E "vga|display|amd"
Paste the output and I’ll guide the next step: ROCm install/validation for your Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 / Radeon 8060S, then we’ll switch back to the LLVM/Triton contribution workflow with real kernel execution available.
