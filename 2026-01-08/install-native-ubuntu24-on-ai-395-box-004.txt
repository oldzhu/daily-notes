Yes — it’s totally fine to put “almost all of D” into / (single big ext4 root), and many people do exactly that. The split / + home layout is just a convention for separation, not a requirement.

Why your WSL df -h looks different
WSL2 is special: your Linux root is inside a virtual disk (ext4.vhdx) and Windows drives are mounted under c, d. Native Ubuntu won’t look like that: / will be a real ext4 partition on the NVMe.

Two layouts you’re deciding between
Layout A — “Single big root” (recommended for simplicity)
EFI: ~1GB FAT32 mounted at /boot/efi
Root: the rest of disk ext4 mounted at /
No separate home partition (it’s just a directory inside /)
Pros

Simplest install and simplest to manage.
No guessing “how big should / be?” later.
No risk of “/ is full but /home has tons of space” (a common annoyance when building LLVM).
Easier when you want lots of large build dirs, caches, Docker images, etc.
Cons

If you ever need to reinstall Ubuntu, it’s harder to preserve home separately (you can still back it up, but it’s not partition-isolated).
Less isolation between OS files and your data (not usually a problem for personal dev machines).
Layout B — “Split / and /home” (good if you reinstall often)
EFI: ~1GB FAT32 /boot/efi
Root: 300–400GB ext4 /
Home: rest ext4 home
Pros

Easier reinstall: you can reformat / and keep home intact (carefully).
Clear separation: OS vs user data.
Cons (real ones for compiler work)

You must size / correctly. LLVM + ROCm + build deps + multiple builds can grow; if / fills up, things break in annoying ways.
Space is not shared dynamically; you can end up with free space in home while / is full.
What I recommend for your specific use case (LLVM/Triton/ROCm)
If you want the least friction and you’re not constantly reinstalling: Layout A (single big /).

A practical “LLVM dev” partition plan on D:

EFI: 1GB FAT32 /boot/efi
Root: ~1.8TB ext4 /
Swap: skip partition; use swapfile later if needed
If you do want the reinstall convenience of split home but avoid the “/ full” trap, then bump / bigger than the usual desktop advice:

/: 500–800GB
home: rest
That’s a good compromise for heavy builds.

Answer to your direct question
“Is it fine to mount all D partition except the one for efi to /?”

Yes. That’s the simplest and usually best for a dev box doing large builds.

One small correction from earlier
If you do split partitions, the home mount point is home (with a leading /), not home.

If you tell me whether you value “easy reinstall” vs “never worry about partition sizing”, I’ll give you the exact partition sizes to enter in the Ubuntu installer screen.
