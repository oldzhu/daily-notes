I'll diff the current services.py against the previous commit to enumerate all changes and verify only the intended sections changed.


git --no-pager diff --unified=0 HEAD~1 -- src/gdbplugin/sos/services.py
I'll revert lldb_get_current_thread_id, lldb_set_current_thread_id, and lldb_get_thread_id_by_system_id to the previous commit's behavior to ensure only the intended changes remain, then run a syntax check and show a concise diff.

services.py+13-47

python3 -m py_compile /workspaces/gdbsos/src/gdbplugin/sos/services.py

git --no-pager diff --unified=0 HEAD~1 -- src/gdbplugin/sos/services.py | sed -n '1752,2130p'
Thanks for double-checking before testing. I compared the current services.py against the previous commit and ensured only the intended areas changed.

What I verified and adjusted

lldb_disassemble

Updated as planned: Intel flavor switch, x/2i to compute instruction length, percent-escaping, safe buffer write, endOffset advancement, [disasm] traces, and flavor restoration.
This is the primary intended change and remains.
lldb_get_thread_id_by_system_id

Confirmed it existed in the previous commit.
Re-added using the same simple behavior as before (scan threads, match system id, return engine index). This prevents the AttributeError you saw.
lldb_get_thread_context_by_system_id

Not touched in this pass, aside from ensuring its presence is unchanged. It was present before and remains intact.
lldb_get_current_thread_id and lldb_set_current_thread_id

I initially made small defensive edits. To honor your request, I restored them to the exact previous-commit behavior:
get_current_thread_id: finds the engine index by comparing ptid of the selected thread with the thread list.
set_current_thread_id: switches to the thread by index and updates _current_thread_sysid, always returns 0 (as before).
Stray or accidental changes

Removed the accidental earlier splices; no unrelated logic should be changed now.
Sanity checks

Syntax: PASS (py_compile on the file).
Minimal diff scope: After restoration, differences are limited to:
The improved lldb_disassemble implementation.
The re-added lldb_get_thread_id_by_system_id (matching prior commit semantics).
No other behavior changes to thread selection methods.
You can proceed to test. If any behavior deviates, we can pin it further with a targeted diff against your artifact copies, but the source now matches the prior commitâ€™s behavior aside from the disassembly improvements and the re-addition of the missing method.
