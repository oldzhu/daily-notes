How to use
Columns (defaults)
Mnemonic starts at column 39 by default.
Override via SOS_GDB_DISASM_MNEMONIC_COL and SOS_GDB_DISASM_OPERAND_COL.
Optional columns
SOS_GDB_DISASM_ADDR=1 to include address.
SOS_GDB_DISASM_BYTES=1 to include contiguous raw bytes.
RIP normalization
Enabled by default: SOS_GDB_DISASM_CANONICAL_RIP=1
Disable with SOS_GDB_DISASM_CANONICAL_RIP=0
Example (like you used before):

SOS_GDB_DISASM_ADDR=1 SOS_GDB_DISASM_BYTES=1 SOS_GDB_DISASM_MNEMONIC_COL=40 gdb …
Quick checks
Syntax: Python compile PASS for all modified files.
Requirements coverage
Change default SOS_GDB_DISASM_MNEMONIC_COL to 39: Done.
Normalize RIP displacement: Done (env-togglable, default on).
If you’re happy with the output, I can move on to source mapping next (lldb_get_line_by_offset via “info line ADDR”), adding minimal tracing and keeping it opt-in to avoid noise.
