how do u think to add suopport radare2 in our dbgcopilot project like we support lldb and gdb? just quick think, do not go to implement right now.
========
Adding Radare2 Support

Backend choice: decide on a radare2 interface—either drive r2 -q0 with pexpect (like GDB subprocess) for portability, or use the native r2pipe Python API for tighter integration. Offering both and auto-selecting (fast path: r2pipe → fallback: subprocess) mirrors current LLDB handling.
New backend class: add R2Backend under backends, exposing initialize_session, run_command, and prompt attributes consistent with existing backends. Handle command splitting, prompt stripping, and exit/cleanup.
Session manager wiring: extend SessionManager._create_backend to recognize "radare2" (or "r2"), configure prompt text, and ensure ANSI output is preserved (re-using recent work).
REPL + CLI: update standalone REPLs (plugins/*/repl.py, index.html debugger dropdown) to list radare2, routing commands through the new backend.
Prompting/LLM context: add tool instructions and prompt snippets describing radare2 command syntax and capabilities so the orchestrator suggests meaningful commands.
Testing: craft basic smoke tests (load sample binary, run aaa, s main, pdf) to prove command execution. If feasible, bundle a tiny example binary in examples for automated coverage.
Dependencies & packaging: document radare2/r2pipe requirements in README/configs. Optionally detect absence and surface clear guidance to users.
Future niceties: translate common operations between GDB/LLDB and radare2 for command suggestions, and consider structured JSON output (r2 -q0j) if we want richer parsing down the road.
Once we agree on interface + scope, we can start implementing incrementally (backend first, then UI/LLM glue).
