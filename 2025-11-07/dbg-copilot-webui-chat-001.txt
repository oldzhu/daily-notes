============
Chat UI Updates

Added an auto-approve checkbox (index.html) to the left of the send button; it stays unchecked by default and drives a new /api/sessions/{id}/auto-approve endpoint so toggles persist across the active session and future launches.
Shrunk and restyled chat controls (styles.css, app.js): the send button now uses a compact footprint, the checkbox uses the same compact sizing, and status feedback appears if you flip it without an active session.
Applied VS Code-inspired typography to the chat history (styles.css): fonts now use var(--vscode-font-family, "Segoe UI", …) at 0.8rem (~12.8 px) with tighter spacing so more conversation fits on screen.
Backend Support

Plumbed the auto-approve flag through session creation and added server-side toggling (session_manager.py, routes.py) so UI changes update SessionState.auto_accept_commands immediately.
Tests

pytest -q
Next: reload the web UI, confirm the checkbox/controls layout, flip the toggle with and without a running session, and make sure auto-approve behavior matches your expectations. Let me know if you’d like the fonts or spacing tweaked further.
