What I found in WSL right now

Vulkan/OpenGL are software-rendering: vulkaninfo --summary and glxinfo -B both report llvmpipe, not a GPU-backed driver.
ROCm-for-WSL is installed, but no GPU is enumerated:
rocminfo detects “WSL environment”, but lists only a single CPU agent (no Device Type: GPU, no gfx* agent).
clinfo shows 1 AMD platform but 0 devices.
The “native Linux ROCm” device nodes aren’t present: no /dev/kfd, no /dev/dri.
amd-smi fails with “amdgpu not found in modules” (it’s expecting native amdgpu, which WSL GPU-PV typically doesn’t provide).
Implication

Your gfx1151 AMDGPU kernel backport is compiled/booting, but ROCm detection in this WSL GPU-PV setup is currently blocked at the DXG/ROCm-for-WSL exposure layer (not at Linux PCI/DRM amdgpu probing).
If you want, I can next:

Pull a more targeted rocminfo/HSA debug trace (now that strace is installed) to see exactly what adapter enumeration returns, or
Walk through the Windows-side checks that usually gate ROCm-for-WSL GPU exposure (driver/channel/version expectations), then re-test rocminfo after each change.
