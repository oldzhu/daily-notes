Based on what’s actually written in that WSL driver release note, 24.10.21.01 for WSL 2 does not claim support for Radeon 8060S / gfx1151.

What the release notes explicitly support
In the “Radeon Product Compatibility” section of https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-24-10-21-01-WSL-2.html it lists only these products:

AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX
AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT
AMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE
AMD Radeon PRO W7900
AMD Radeon PRO W7800
AMD Radeon PRO W7900 Dual Slot
There is no mention of:

Radeon 8060S
Ryzen AI MAX / AI Max 300 series
gfx1151 / “GC 11.5.x”
any “Ryzen APU” class hardware
What that means for you

If the host Windows driver package doesn’t support/expose your iGPU for WSL compute, then WSL ROCm will stay CPU-only (exactly what you’re seeing with rocminfo), even if you install that WSL driver.
Also, that WSL package is from 2024 and looks targeted at a narrow set of RDNA3 dGPUs; your 8060S (gfx1151) is a newer APU class target.
Best next step

You likely need a newer WSL/ROCm-on-Windows driver package that explicitly mentions Ryzen AI Max / APU support (or at least doesn’t restrict compatibility to only RX 7900 / PRO W7x00).
Separately (Linux-side), enabling CONFIG_DRM_ACCEL=y in your WSL kernel is still worth doing because the WSL HSA runtime probes /dev/accel/*—but that alone won’t help if the Windows driver doesn’t expose a supported WSL compute adapter.
If you want, paste the “Radeon Product Compatibility” section from any newer AMD WSL/ROCm Windows driver release note you’re considering, and I’ll sanity-check whether it plausibly covers 8060S/gfx1151.
