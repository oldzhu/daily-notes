I’ve double-checked and aligned the active artifacts, and I’ll briefly explain how LLDB’s SOS wiring delivers notifications so bpmd can bind.

actions taken
Verified parity across services:
services.py: Stop/new-objfile hooks, immediate-callback helpers, and fallback breakpoint are present. Fixed duplicate stop-handler and indentation.
services.py: Brought to parity and fixed indentation issues in init and dbg_flush_check. Confirmed the following exist:
Global stop hook that invokes SOS’s exception callback on each stop.
New-objfile hook to detect libcoreclr.so and invoke runtime-loaded + exception callbacks once.
Immediate-callback helpers: invoke callbacks right away if CoreCLR is already mapped.
Fallback one-shot breakpoint on coreclr_execute_assembly in both runtime-loaded and exception-callback paths.
Validated syntax: no errors reported in services.py, services.py, or services.py.
Checkpoint summary

Changed files:
services.py: fixed init indentation for new hook fields.
services.py: fixed indentation, removed duplicate stop-handler, kept all hooks and fallbacks.
services.py: fixed indentation and kept all hooks and fallbacks.
Quality gates: Lint/syntax PASS (no errors).
how LLDB plugin delivers notifications to SOS
Callback contracts:

SOS registers two callbacks with the host:
“Runtime loaded” callback (via ILLDBServices2::SetRuntimeLoadedCallback).
“Exception” callback (via ILLDBServices::SetExceptionCallback) that SOS uses as a generic “CLR notification pump” to bind pending breakpoints (bpmd), process module loads, JIT events, etc.
LLDB-side delivery:

The plugin installs one or more mechanisms to guarantee these callbacks get invoked:
A listener or breakpoint that guarantees at least one stop early in CoreCLR startup (often a one-shot BP on the runtime entry/known symbol).
Stop/event wiring that, on process stops, calls back into SOS via the stored exception callback so it can process any pending CLR notifications.
A module-load (new objfile) hook: when libcoreclr.so loads, it invokes the runtime-loaded callback and then the exception callback once to jump-start bpmd binding.
If CoreCLR is already loaded when the callback is registered, the plugin invokes the callbacks immediately once.
Result: When you issue bpmd, SOS sets pending managed BPs; as stops occur (or immediately/at module load), the plugin calls the exception callback, SOS observes CLR loader/JIT events, and it binds bpmd to real IPs.
Our GDB plugin mirrors this:

Global stop hook → invoke SOS’s exception callback on each stop (with a re-entrancy guard).
New-objfile hook → when libcoreclr.so appears, invoke runtime-loaded then exception callback once and disconnect.
Immediate-invocation helpers → call callbacks right away if CoreCLR is already mapped.
Fallback one-shot breakpoint on coreclr_execute_assembly to ensure at least one stop to deliver notifications even if the user set different breakpoints.
what’s next
Please retry your manual scenario and look for:
“[new-objfile] detected ...”, “[invoke] RuntimeLoaded callback ...”, “[invoke] Exception callback ...”, or “[stop-hook] Exception callback ...”.
Confirm that bpmd binds and the managed breakpoint is hit.
If it still doesn’t bind, we can add one or two extra traces around callback registration sites to verify SOS registers the exception callback early enough for your flow.
