Good news: the amdgpu.ko we installed matches your new kernel (vermagic is 6.6.114.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2+). The blocker now is runtime firmware: none of the gc_11_5_1_* blobs are present in /lib/firmware/amdgpu/, so AMDGPU won’t fully bring up gfx1151. Next I’ll try the distro firmware packages (lowest-effort), then we’ll re-check for those exact blobs.

set -euo pipefail; sudo apt-get update -y; sudo apt-get install -y linux-firmware linux-firmware-amd-graphics || sudo apt-get install -y linux-firmware; echo "--- firmware presence after install ---"; ls -1 /lib/firmware/amdgpu 2>/dev/null | egrep -i 'gc_11_5_1_(pfp|me|mec|rlc|mes1|mes_2|imu)\.bin' | sort || true; echo "--- missing? ---"; for f in gc_11_5_1_pfp.bin gc_11_5_1_me.bin gc_11_5_1_mec.bin gc_11_5_1_rlc.bin gc_11_5_1_mes1.bin gc_11_5_1_mes_2.bin gc_11_5_1_imu.bin; do test -e "/lib/firmware/amdgpu/$f" || echo "MISSING $f"; done


You’re right to pause here: whether /lib/firmware matters depends on whether the Linux kernel inside WSL is actually driving the AMD GPU as a real PCI device.

WSL2 GPU model (most common)

WSL2 typically does not expose the physical GPU to Linux as a PCI device.
Instead, Linux talks to Windows’ GPU stack through the paravirtual “DirectX” bridge (dxgkrnl) and you usually see dxg.
In that model, the in-WSL Linux kernel does not load AMD GPU firmware and the Linux amdgpu kernel driver usually does not bind to the physical Radeon 8060S at all.
So: missing /lib/firmware is not automatically a problem in WSL2. It only becomes relevant if you are doing a setup where Linux amdgpu is actually probing a GPU device and calling request_firmware().

Quick, non-invasive checks to decide which model you’re in
Run these inside WSL:

Is the GPU exposed as PCI in Linux?
lspci -nn | egrep -i "vga|display|3d|amd|ati" || true
Is the DirectX bridge device present? (Typical WSL GPU path)
ls -la /dev/dxg 2>/dev/null || echo "no /dev/dxg"
Do we have any DRM render nodes at all?
ls -la /dev/dri 2>/dev/null || echo "no /dev/dri"
Is amdgpu actually loading/probing?
dmesg -T | egrep -i "amdgpu|kfd|gfx|gc_|firmware" | tail -n 200
About /lib/firmware specifically

On many modern distros, lib is merged into lib. So even if /lib/firmware doesn’t exist, you might have /usr/lib/firmware:
ls -ld /lib /usr/lib
ls -la /usr/lib/firmware 2>/dev/null || echo "no /usr/lib/firmware"
If lspci shows no AMD GPU, and you do see dxg, then “detect Radeon 8060S gfx1151” via Linux amdgpu is generally not the right test—you’d instead validate the Windows-side driver + the WSL bridge path (and whatever ROCm-on-WSL user-space is supposed to use).

If you paste outputs of (1)–(4), I’ll tell you which path you’re on and what the correct “gfx1151 detected” validation should look like in that environment.
