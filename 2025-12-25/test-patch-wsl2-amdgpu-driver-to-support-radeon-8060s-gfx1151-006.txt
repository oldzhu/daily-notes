Based on your outputs:

lspci shows only Microsoft virtual 3D devices (1414:*), not an AMD PCI GPU
dxg exists
/dev/dri does not exist
That means you’re in the normal WSL2 GPU-PV / DXG model. In this mode, Linux is not binding the physical Radeon 8060S with the Linux amdgpu DRM driver at all, so:

Your GC 11.5.1 / gfx1151 backport won’t affect “GPU detection” inside WSL in the way it would on bare metal Linux.
Firmware under /lib/firmware (or /usr/lib/firmware) is typically not used for the GPU-PV path, because the Windows host driver owns the real GPU/firmware.
What you can test in WSL2 (meaningful for your custom kernel)
Confirm WSL booted your custom kernel:
uname -r
cat /proc/version
Confirm the DXG bridge is working (this is the GPU path WSL actually uses):
ls -la /dev/dxg
dmesg -T | egrep -i "dxg|dxgkrnl" | tail -n 200
Confirm user-space can see a GPU via the DX stack (WSLg / Vulkan-on-D3D12 path):
ls -la /usr/lib/wsl/lib | egrep -i "dxcore|d3d12|vulkan" || true
If you have WSLg and tools installed: vulkaninfo --summary (package: vulkan-tools)
Optionally: glxinfo -B (package: mesa-utils) if you’re using WSLg GUI apps
Confirm what GPU Windows thinks it has (from inside WSL, querying the host):
powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command "Get-CimInstance Win32_VideoController | Select-Object Name, DriverVersion, PNPDeviceID | Format-List"
This will show “Radeon 8060S” on the Windows side, which is the device actually driving your GPU under WSL.

What you cannot validate in WSL2 (with current hardware exposure)
You cannot validate “Linux amdgpu detects gfx1151 / GC 11.5.1” because the AMD PCI device is not exposed to Linux, and there’s no /dev/dri render node.

How to truly test gfx1151 Linux AMDGPU detection
You need an environment where the AMD GPU is exposed as a real PCI device to Linux, e.g.:

Bare metal Linux boot (same kernel build)
A VM with PCIe passthrough of the Radeon GPU
Then the validation looks like:

lspci -nn | egrep -i "amd|ati|vga|display"
dmesg -T | egrep -i "amdgpu|gfx1151|gc_11_5|firmware"
/dev/dri/renderD* exists, and modprobe amdgpu loads successfully.
If you tell me whether your goal is WSL2 GPU compute via DXG (ROCm-on-WSL style) or real Linux AMDGPU driver enablement (bare metal / passthrough), I’ll give the exact next validation steps for that path.
