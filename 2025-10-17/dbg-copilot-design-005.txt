pls proceed to the stage which we can start to run some simple tests if we config. Whenever we can start to test, the next steps would be:

create a local git repo and commit the changes and push to github.
2, after push to githugm,we can begin manual tests and fix if see any probems or modify if want to do some changes possibly tomorrow.
============
I’ll wrap up this stage so we’re ready for container-based testing tomorrow: we’ve committed the scaffold locally, and I added a Makefile plus Docker/devcontainer setup so you can build and run tests in a container when the network is stable.

Actions taken
Added Docker/devcontainer and Makefile targets for container workflows.
Initialized a local git repo and made the first commit with all scaffolding.
Current state
Local git repo: initialized and committed.
Docker image build: deferred due to network instability. Make targets are ready.
Tests: a smoke test exists; we’ll run it inside the container once image build works.
How to proceed tomorrow
Build the dev image and run tests inside the container:


make docker-buildmake docker-pytest
Open an interactive shell in the container:


make docker-shell
Try GDB/LLDB inside the container:


make gdb-shell# ormake lldb-shell
Manual GDB plugin check (inside gdb-shell, later when we wire real backend):

In GDB:
source /workspace/plugins/gdb/copilot_cmd.py
copilot new
ask/exec/summary from the nested copilot> prompt
Push to GitHub
Share your preferred GitHub repo URL, and I’ll add it as a remote and push the current master/main. If you want the default branch to be main, I can rename the branch before pushing.

Provide: https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git
Optional: prefer branch name “main” instead of “master”?
Once you give me the remote URL and branch preference, I’ll:

Set the remote
Rename the branch to main if you want
Push the initial commit
Quality gates (scaffold)

Build: N/A for Python package yet. Docker build pending network.
Lint/Typecheck: Not configured yet.
Tests: Import smoke test present; we’ll run it inside the container post-build.
Next coding step after push

Implement real GDB in-process backend calls (gdb.execute(..., to_string=True), pagination off).
Fill in prompt templates and wire the first LangChain-backed “ask/suggest” path.
Add “view” command to write/update reports/<session>.md per interaction.
Share the GitHub remote and branch preference, and I’ll push right away.
