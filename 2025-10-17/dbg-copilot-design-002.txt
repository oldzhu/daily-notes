basically fine, but still thinking on UX behavior, two options I am thinking:

nested copilot> as the above, all interactive with LLM and gdb (question/reply and executed gdb commands output) will be in nested copilot>.
separated copilot console window accompanyied with gdb console window(interractive with LLM (question and response) is in copilot console and gdb command execution and output will be in oringinal console )
do u think which one is better? pros and cons or any other good UX behavior you could advice?

=================

I’ll update the tracked tasks to reflect that the UX decision is being discussed and add a subfocus on UI adapters (nested vs sidecar), then summarize pros/cons and recommend a path.

Updated todo list

Thanks for narrowing the UX—let’s compare the two options and pick a pragmatic path that fits a debugger workflow.

Option 1: Nested copilot> inside the debugger
How it works

You enter a sub-REPL inside GDB/LLDB, e.g.:
(gdb) copilot new
copilot> ask …
copilot> exec bt
All LLM Q&A and any gdb command execution and annotated outputs appear inside this nested prompt.
Pros

Single terminal focus: no context-switching, great for SSH/tmux and headless environments.
Easy transcript capture: one stream includes questions, decisions, and the exact outputs.
Fewer moving parts: simpler to implement in GDB/LLDB Python plugins.
Clear mode semantics: copilot> indicates you’re in the “assisted” context.
Cons

Interleaving: copilot logs and raw gdb outputs are mixed; can get noisy in long sessions.
Limited layout: harder to view side-by-side “explain on the left, output on the right.”
Navigation friction: flipping in/out of copilot> to run native gdb commands directly.
Best for

Terminal-native workflows, SSH, tmux, CI reproductions, minimal setup.
Option 2: Separate “copilot console” alongside the debugger
How it works

Two panes: one is GDB/LLDB, the other is Copilot console.
You ask LLM in the copilot console; when executing commands, they run in GDB and outputs remain in the GDB console. Copilot console shows the analysis, plan, and confirmations.
Pros

Visual separation: analysis thread is clean; GDB stays pure for command I/O.
Better readability: you can scroll each stream independently; fewer mixed messages.
Easier long-form explanations and rich formatting in the copilot pane (if supported).
Potential to add small UI niceties (links to frames, collapsible snippets) later.
Cons

Coordination complexity: need IPC or a shared session bus between copilot and debugger.
Terminal setup: requires multiplexer/split panes or an IDE integration; can break in non-TTY contexts.
Transcript stitching: you’ll likely maintain a combined session log across two streams.
Best for

Local development with a terminal multiplexer or IDE; users who value clean separation.
A third hybrid: Inline prompts with sidecar summaries on demand
How it works

Default to nested copilot> for simple use.
Provide a “copilot view” command that opens a sidecar (if available) or writes a live HTML/Markdown view to a file that users can open in a viewer. The sidecar shows structured summaries, plan, and report, while the main GDB remains active.
The system continues to function entirely in a single terminal when the sidecar isn’t available.
Pros

Keeps a robust terminal-only baseline.
Offers a better reading experience when users want it, without being mandatory.
Avoids hard dependency on panes or IDEs.
Cons

Slightly more implementation than nested-only, but less than full two-way console IPC.
Sidecar may lag a bit if it’s a file-based view.
Recommendation for POC
Start with Option 1 (nested copilot>) as the default. It’s simpler, works everywhere, and aligns with your command design.
Add a light-weight “sidecar view” as a hybrid:
copilot view open — generate an updating Markdown/HTML report (summary/plan/facts/latest outputs) under reports/<session>.md/html that can be opened in another pane/editor. Refresh it after each interaction.
This gives most of the readability benefits without IPC complexity.
Plan for Option 2 later:
Define a thin IPC abstraction (local socket or file-based queue) so a future copilot console can decouple display from execution.
Small UX refinements regardless of choice
Prompt affordances
Prefix LLM-generated lines with a subtle tag, e.g., [copilot], and keep gdb raw output untagged or fenced for readability.
Provide copilot quiet mode to show only essential summaries, and verbose mode to include reasoning (still no chain-of-thought; show conclusions and evidence).
Structured snippets
After commands that produce large outputs, automatically cache a trimmed snippet and allow “copilot show last [head|tail|frame N]”.
Confirmations
copilot safe-mode on: deny or require confirm for state changes (kill, detach, set, continue).
Quick toggles
copilot mode interactive|auto
copilot goal <text>
copilot suggest — a shortcut for proposing next 1–3 commands with short rationale.
Panes cheat sheet (if user wants a 2-pane view)
Recommend tmux or IDE terminal split. Provide a minimal “live view” file they can tail or open.
If you’re aligned with this, I’ll incorporate the hybrid “view” concept into the layout and prompts and proceed to draft:

The folder/file layout (including a simple report/view generator).
The prompt templates with tags and concise formatting tuned for the nested experience.
The command behavior specs for confirm/safe-mode and quiet/verbose.
Want Option 1 + hybrid view for POC? Or do you prefer to aim for full sidecar console from the start despite the extra plumbing?
