I’ve scaffolded the project for the nested copilot> POC plus a lightweight “view,” keeping logic minimal so you can review and iterate. Nothing heavy was implemented; the structure is ready to wire LangChain and the in-process GDB backend next.

Actions taken
Created a clean skeleton with GDB plugin commands and a nested copilot> REPL placeholder.
Added core modules (orchestrator, state, report) and prompt templates.
Included configs, utils, a basic README, and a smoke test.
Validated no syntax errors.
Files added (high level)
README.md — overview and usage notes.
src/dbgcopilot/
init.py — package init.
core/
orchestrator.py — placeholder agent orchestrator.
state.py — simple session state and attempt models.
report.py — minimal Markdown report builder and writer.
backends/
base.py — DebuggerBackend protocol.
gdb_inprocess.py — placeholder; returns canned outputs.
prompts/ — initial prompt templates:
tool_instructions.md, suggest_commands.md, summarize_output.md,
plan_and_analyze.md, auto_debug_loop.md, report_template.md, safety.md
utils/
io.py — ANSI stripping and head/tail truncation.
plugins/gdb/
copilot_cmd.py — registers copilot new/ask/summary.
repl.py — nested copilot> loop: ask, exec, goal, summary.
default.yaml — default settings.
test_smoke_structure.py — basic import test.
How it behaves now (placeholder)
In GDB, you can source the plugin and run:
(gdb) copilot new → starts a new session and enters copilot> prompt.
copilot> ask Why did it crash? → placeholder suggests bt with a prompt-like message.
copilot> exec bt → uses a canned backend output, logs attempt.
copilot> goal …, summary → store goal, show placeholder summary.
No real LLM or GDB API calls yet; that’s next.
Suggested next steps
Prompt templates: refine content for gdb flavor (short, actionable).
Wire real GDB in-process calls:
Use gdb.execute('cmd', to_string=True) and set pagination/height off in initialize_session.
Introduce LangChain:
Load prompts and implement suggest/ask/plan/auto in orchestrator.
Add a minimal provider config parser honoring default.yaml and environment variables.
Add “view”:
A small function to write/update reports/<session>.md after each interaction and a copilot view command to open/refresh.
If you’re happy with this scaffold, I’ll proceed to:

Implement the real GDB backend methods (initialize_session, run_command).
Draft the initial prompt texts more concretely.
Integrate a simple LLM call (provider flag-gated) for copilot ask and suggest, while keeping confirmations in the REPL.
