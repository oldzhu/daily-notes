that is not exactly what I want, what I want to is it is like gdb or lldb extenstion or plugin commands, commands like copilot config, copilot new, copilot ask, copilot mode, copilot summary...
copilot config - configure langchain LLM backend
copilot new - save previous copilot chat session if there is and start a new one chat session
copilot mode - interractive mode or auto mode.
copilot summary - summary the current copilot chat session.
after copilot new, we will have copilot prompt like colipot> the default copilot mode is interactive, which means we will intactive with backend LLM and gdb with copilot> ptompt, such as ask llm debugging questions, run gdb command and ask llm to analtsis, one same flow is lke -
ask llm what command can be used for what? llm reply with the suggested command, ask if want to execute, you can say yes to go execute or no to ask to execute another command or ask anoher question, if command executed, u can ask to explain the output or ask the next question, in auto mode, u just give the gonal,copilot will plan and execute automatoically until archive the goal or reached the max intetrations reached.
=======

’m updating the plan to reflect a GDB/LLDB plugin-style command set, then I’ll lay out the concrete command UX, architecture fit, and folder layout—no file changes yet.

Starting (3/9) Specify command set and UX

Got it — we’ll design this as a GDB/LLDB plugin-style command set that adds “copilot …” commands directly in the debugger, with an interactive copilot> prompt and an auto mode. Here’s a focused plan for the command UX, architecture, and layout (no file changes yet).

What we’ll design now
Command set and UX inside GDB/LLDB
How those commands map to the LangChain agent and backend
Folder layout that supports gdb/lldb plugins, prompt-driven behavior, and sessions
Prompt templates needed to power the flows
I’ve updated the todo list to reflect the plugin model and started detailing the command UX and architecture.

Command set and UX
Core commands (GDB and LLDB names the same):

copilot config [key] [value]

Configure LLM provider/model/temperature, timeouts, auto limits.
Examples:
copilot config provider openai
copilot config model gpt-4o-mini
copilot config auto.max_steps 5
No restarts needed; updates session config.
copilot new

Save previous copilot chat session (transcript, report) if present.
Create a new session and show copilot> prompt.
Mode defaults to interactive.
copilot mode [interactive|auto]

Switch mode. In auto: requires a goal to begin.
If no goal set, prompt user to set one:
copilot> goal Find the cause of SIGSEGV on startup
copilot ask [freeform question]

Send a question to LLM with the current context: last command/output, session facts, goal.
Typical flows:
Suggest commands: LLM proposes 1-3 GDB commands with rationale.
Copilot asks: “Execute ‘bt’? [y/N/other]”
y: run via GDB, show output, then copilot offers analysis/suggestions.
N: user can type another question or “exec <alt-cmd>”.
Post-execution, user can ask: “Explain the output” or “What next?”
copilot summary

Summarize the current session so far: goal, key findings, commands run, next steps.
Output concise bullets, with short evidence snippets.
Interactive loop

After copilot new, a nested copilot> prompt is available (runs inside debugger context).
At copilot>:
ask Why did it crash?
suggest bt
exec bt
analyze last
goal Diagnose SIGSEGV in foo()
Confirmations: destructive or state-modifying commands require confirmation (e.g., set, kill, detach).
User can always run standard GDB commands outside copilot> or via exec within it.
Auto mode loop

Mode set to auto and a goal provided:
LLM plans up to N steps (configurable).
Executes step-by-step:
Run command, capture output, analyze, update facts.
Stop on success, ambiguity, or risk; ask for confirmation when needed.
On stop, produce a brief status and recommended next steps.
User can switch back to interactive anytime: copilot mode interactive.
Optional extended commands

copilot suggest [topic?] — ask LLM “what commands now?”
copilot exec [raw gdb cmd] — run a GDB command within copilot context (logged and analyzable).
copilot analyze [context?] — force an analysis pass on the last outputs.
copilot report — generate a Markdown report and persist it.
Architecture fit
GDB/LLDB plugin layer

GDB: Python pretty-printer/plugins via python command or source a .py file to register copilot command namespace. Implement a CopilotCommand that dispatches subcommands: config/new/mode/ask/summary/exec/…
LLDB: Scripted command via Python binding: command script add -f module.handler copilot.
Both call into a shared Python package dbgcopilot that:
Holds session state per debugger instance.
Provides a copilot REPL handler for the nested copilot> prompt.
Shared Copilot core (LangChain)

Agent orchestrator: tools include:
run_gdb_command(cmd) — executes in current debugger session and returns plaintext.
session tools: set_goal, get_summary, generate_report.
Prompts drive most behaviors: suggest commands, explain output, plan steps, auto loop instructions.
Backend abstraction

For GDB plugin, the backend is an “in-process” adapter that invokes the debugger’s own Python API to run commands and read results.
For LLDB later, a sibling adapter.
State and transcript

SessionState: goal, mode, facts, attempts, last_output, tokens used.
Transcript logs: user q, LLM suggestions, confirmations, gdb outputs (with truncation), and analysis.
Saved under sessions/<timestamp> with report in reports/.
Configuration

Resides in memory and optionally persisted to dotfile/configs file.
copilot config updates live settings.

Prompts needed
tool_instructions.md

How to use tools safely; confirmations for destructive commands; prefer minimal diagnostic commands; never fabricate outputs, quote evidence.
suggest_commands.md

Inputs: goal, known facts, last output snippet.
Output: 1–3 commands with rationale and estimated signal; always low-risk first.
summarize_output.md

Inputs: last command, output (truncated), context.
Output: concise bullets, key findings, next questions.
plan_and_analyze.md

Inputs: goal, current facts, unknowns.
Output: short plan (<=5 steps), expected signals, stop conditions.
auto_debug_loop.md

Execution guidance for one-step-at-a-time auto mode; when to stop/confirm; iteration cap; redaction awareness.
report_template.md

Structure: Context, Repro, Observations, Hypotheses, Evidence, Next Steps, Appendix.
safety.md

Guardrails: no state-changing commands without explicit confirmation; timeouts; token output limits.
POC workflow (command-driven)
Setup in GDB:

(gdb) source /path/to/plugins/gdb/copilot_cmd.py
(gdb) copilot config provider openai
(gdb) copilot new
copilot> ask What’s the likely first command?
LLM: Suggests “bt” — Execute now? [y/N/other]
y → runs bt; prints output; offers explain/next steps.
copilot> ask Explain the output
copilot> mode auto
copilot> goal Diagnose SIGSEGV in foo()
Auto loop runs 1 step at a time until done or needs confirmation.
Summary/report:

(gdb) copilot summary
(gdb) copilot report
Minimal data models
SessionState

goal: str
mode: interactive|auto
facts: list[str] with optional confidence
attempts: [{cmd, output_hash, truncated, ts}]
last_output: str (truncated)
config: provider/model/limits
tokens_used: int
TranscriptEntry

role: user|assistant|tool
content: str
meta: {command?, truncation?, time?}
Edge cases
Pagers and long outputs: set pagination off; truncation with head/tail; offer filters like “frame N”.
Blocking commands: timeouts; suggest safer alternatives.
Detached/killed processes: detect and report; propose new attach or corefile flow.
Symbols missing: suggest debuginfo, set substitute-path, add-symbol-file.
Multi-threading: prefer info threads, focused thread apply patterns.
LLDB parity plan
Mirror command namespace copilot ….
Implement lldb_inprocess.py backend adapter with LLDB Python API.
Map common commands in prompts via a debugger_flavor variable to adjust examples/suggestions.
What I need from you to proceed
Confirm this command set and UX behavior (including the nested copilot> prompt).
Any additional commands you want on day one (e.g., copilot run-plan, copilot stop)?
Preferred LLM provider and default model for initial tests.
Should auto mode default limits be conservative (e.g., 4 steps) and always require confirmation before any state change?
Once you approve, I’ll scaffold the plugin files and placeholders (no heavy logic) for your review before wiring LangChain and the in-process GDB adapter.
