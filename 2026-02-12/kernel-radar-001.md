Yes. RCU code runs at specific, safe points on each CPU to record quiescent states, and RCU’s coordinator code periodically checks those per‑CPU records to decide when a grace period ends or to flag stalls. The key idea is: RCU doesn’t “guess” quiescence; it gets called from known hooks (context switch, idle, user‑mode entry, tick/softirq) to mark quiescent states, then the grace‑period logic uses those marks to detect completion or stalls.
