it worked fine in my testing, now one minor issue as the below

Auto-approved debugger command:

pd 1 @rip
[0x61cf792c317d]>  pd 1 @rip

u could see the above in dbgcopilot repl auto mode, there is line break betwen Auto-approved debugger command and the proposed cmd pd 1 @rip

what I want is, remove the line break between the  Auto-approved debugger command and the proposed cmd pd 1 @rip to make them close as they are closely related - one is proposed by another one
==========

Auto-mode now renders the heading and command as a single block:


Auto-approved debugger command:pd 1 @rip
so there’s no blank line between them in the REPL or dbgweb. Ran the smoke test to confirm everything still passes. Let me know if you’d like any additional spacing tweaks.
