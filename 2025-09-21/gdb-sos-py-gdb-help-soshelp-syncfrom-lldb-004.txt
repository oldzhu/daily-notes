All set—I generated the manifest and the GDB help module, and wired sos.py to optionally consume it so you can test right away.

actions taken
Generated manifest from your latest captures:
manifest: manifest.json
Generated the help module for the GDB plugin:
module: _generated_help.py
Integrated into plugin (safe optional import):
sos.py now tries to import GENERATED_COMMAND_HELP/GENERATED_STATIC_BLOCK/GENERATED_EXPORTS and merges them with existing fallbacks; if the file is missing or malformed, it falls back to the baked-in lists.
files changed
parse_and_manifest.py
Extracts only the soshelp block from pre/post logs and parses via a robust 2+ space column split, ignoring usage suffixes.
generate_gdb_help.py
Merges manifest + overrides and emits src/gdbplugin/sos/_generated_help.py.
_generated_help.py
Newly generated from your capture; contains GENERATED_COMMAND_HELP, GENERATED_STATIC_BLOCK, and GENERATED_EXPORTS stubs.
sos.py
Optionally imports _generated_help and merges data; prefers generated static block when present, otherwise falls back to the baked block.
how to run (optional)
Regenerate from captures (already done this session):

python3 parse_and_manifest.py --in src/tools/syncsoshelp/output --out manifest.json
python3 generate_gdb_help.py --manifest manifest.json --overrides overrides.json --out _generated_help.py
Quick smoke test in GDB:

Start gdb, source the plugin, and run: help sos
You should see the generated static listing; soshelp should use managed/native paths as before.
notes
The lldb_capture.sh help parser is now resilient to wrapped lines and ignores the trailing “For more information…” line, so the pre_help list shouldn’t pollute command names.
The post-run soshelp per-command captures now use the commands listed by post soshelp, which ensures CLR-dependent commands are covered.
commit message (short)
syncsoshelp: robust help parsing + post-run soshelp list; generate manifest and _generated_help.py; wire sos.py to optional import

Let me know how your test goes; if you spot any odd entries in the generated static list, I can tighten the filter to only include known SOS (and wrapper) commands before we finalize.
