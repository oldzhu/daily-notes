SOS_HOSTING: Fail to create hosting delegate 80070002
[sos] Bridge DispatchManagedCommand('dso') => 0x-7fffbffb
Managed command 'dso' failed (HRESULT=0x80004005). Unspecified failure. Try 'sostrace on' for details.

need to make sure bridge so located in the same folder as libsos.so

I’ll fix the split-debug step so objcopy can find the .dbg file and your build completes.

Checklist:

Inspect the bridge CMake split-debug commands
Remove the quoting that breaks objcopy’s --add-gnu-debuglink
Rebuild and verify .so/.dbg and debuglink section
Confirm install and default deploy
Actions taken:

Updated CMakeLists.txt: removed quotes around the debuglink path in the POST_BUILD step so CMake VERBATIM doesn’t pass literal quotes to objcopy.
Before: --add-gnu-debuglink=".../libsosgdbbridge.so.dbg"
After: --add-gnu-debuglink=.../libsosgdbbridge.so.dbg
Rebuilt and installed the bridge; default deploy to diagnostics is still on.
Verification:

Build: PASS (Release)
Split debug: PASS
Generated: libsosgdbbridge.so.dbg
.gnu_debuglink section present in libsosgdbbridge.so
Install: PASS
libsosgdbbridge.so
libsosgdbbridge.so.dbg
Deploy (default): PASS
Copied .so next to diagnostics’ libsos.so at linux.x64.Release
Try it:

Rebuild/install the bridge (diagnostics skipped for speed):
build.sh -c Release --skip-diagnostics
Optional: verify debuglink
readelf -SW libsosgdbbridge.so | grep .gnu_debuglink
Notes:

The failure was due to quoted arg being passed literally to objcopy; removing quotes fixes it.
Deploy copies the .so by default; if you also want the .dbg deployed to diagnostics/current, I can add that.
