To calculate the memory a model occupies, you need to know two things: the **total number of parameters** and the **precision** (data type) of each weight.

### 1. The General Formula

The memory required to store the weights of a model is:


### 2. Common Data Types (Precisions)

In modern AI, weights aren't always full 32-bit floats. We use smaller formats to save memory:

| Data Type | Bits | Bytes per Weight | Common Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **float32 (FP32)** | 32-bit | **4 Bytes** | Original training (rarely used for inference now). |
| **float16 (FP16)** | 16-bit | **2 Bytes** | Standard for most modern models (Llama, GPT). |
| **bfloat16 (BF16)** | 16-bit | **2 Bytes** | Preferred for training stability in large models. |
| **int8 (Quantized)** | 8-bit | **1 Byte** | Compressed models for consumer GPUs. |
| **4-bit (GGUF/EXL2)** | 4-bit | **0.5 Bytes** | Running huge models (70B) on home PCs. |

### 3. Calculating your Sample (Mini-Model)

From our previous example, we calculated **~11,776 weights**.

* **If stored in FP16 (2 bytes):**

* **If stored in FP32 (4 bytes):**

### 4. What does "7B" or "32B" mean?

The "B" stands for **Billion Parameters**. This is a count of the individual numbers (weights) inside all the matrices (, etc.) combined.

#### Example: Calculating memory for a **7B Model** (like Llama 3 8B)

Most models are distributed in **16-bit (2 bytes per weight)** format.

1. **Count:**  weights.
2. **Multiply by Bytes:** .
3. **Convert to Gigabytes:** .

**Rule of Thumb:** A 16-bit model needs roughly ** its parameter count** in GB of VRAM.

* **7B Model:**  GB VRAM.
* **32B Model:**  GB VRAM.
* **70B Model:**  GB VRAM.

### 5. Why do we need more VRAM than this?

When you actually *run* the model (inference), the memory usage is higher than just the weights because of the **KV Cache**:

* **Weights:** The "static" memory (the 14 GB for a 7B model).
* **KV Cache:** The "dynamic" memory used to store the context of your conversation. As your chat gets longer, the model needs more VRAM to "remember" the previous tokens' Keys and Values so it doesn't have to re-calculate them every time.

### 6. Summary: Training vs. Inference Memory

During **training**, memory usage is even higher (usually  to  the model size) because the GPU must also store:

1. **Gradients:** Same size as the model.
2. **Optimizer States:** (Like AdamW) Usually  to  the model size.
3. **Activations:** Temporary numbers stored during the forward pass to be used in the backward pass.

**Would you like to know how "Quantization" (converting 16-bit to 4-bit) affects the intelligence of these 7B or 32B models?**
