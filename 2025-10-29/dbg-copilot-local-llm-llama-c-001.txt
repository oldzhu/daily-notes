Of course! Moving from Ollama to llama.cpp is a great step to get more control and potentially better performance. Here is a detailed, step-by-step guide to setting up llama.cpp on your WSL2 host, specifically tailored for your hardware.

Step 1: Install Prerequisites
You'll need a C++ compiler, Git, and the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit to leverage your RTX 3080.

Update your package list and install build tools:
bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git build-essential
Install the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit:
Go to the official NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit download page: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
Select the following options:
Operating System: Linux
Architecture: x86_64
Distribution: WSL-Ubuntu
Version: 2.0 (or your specific WSL version)
Installer Type: deb (local)
Follow the instructions on the page. It will give you commands to download and install a .deb file. This is the most reliable way to get CUDA set up correctly in WSL2.
Verify CUDA Installation:
After installation, open a new WSL2 terminal and run:
bash

nvcc --version
You should see the CUDA compiler version, confirming it's installed and in your PATH.
Step 2: Clone and Compile llama.cpp
Now we'll get the llama.cpp code and compile it with GPU support.

Clone the repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git
cd llama.cpp
Compile with CUDA support:
This is the most important step. The make command will compile the code. We use flags to tell it to enable support for your hardware.

# LLAMA_CUBLAS=1 enables NVIDIA GPU support (CUBLAS is NVIDIA's library)
# LLAMA_AVX2=1 and LLAMA_FMA=1 enable CPU optimizations for your Ryzen 9 CPU
make LLAMA_CUBLAS=1 LLAMA_AVX2=1 LLAMA_FMA=1
This will take a few minutes. You'll see a lot of compilation output. If it completes without errors, you're ready!
Step 3: Download a Model
llama.cpp doesn't download models for you. You need to get them manually. The best format for llama.cpp is GGUF.

Go to Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/models
Find a model: A great starting point is a quantized version of Llama 3 8B. The user "TheBloke" is famous for providing high-quality, pre-quantized models.
Search for: "TheBloke Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF"
Go to the "Files and versions" tab.
Choose a quantization file: For your 16GB VRAM, you can run a high-quality quantization. I recommend the Q4_K_M version. It's an excellent balance of file size, performance, and quality.
Look for a file named Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf (around 4.94 GB).
Download the file from WSL2:
Right-click the download button on Hugging Face and select "Copy Link Address". Then use wget in your WSL2 terminal to download it directly into your llama.cpp directory.
bash

# Make sure you are in the llama.cpp directory
wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf
Step 4: Run a Model Interactively (Test)
Let's test it by running a chat session directly from the command line.

bash

./main -m ./Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf \
       -n 256 \
       --color \
       -c 4096 \
       --in-prefix " " \
       -ngl 99 \
       -p "You are a helpful assistant. Explain the difference between a stack and a heap in C++."
Breaking down the command:

-m ./...: Specifies the model file.
-n 256: Generate a maximum of 256 tokens.
--color: Makes the output colorful.
-c 4096: Sets the context window to 4096 tokens.
-ngl 99: This is the magic flag. It stands for "N GPU Layers". Setting it to a high number like 99 tells llama.cpp to offload as many layers as possible to your GPU's VRAM. For an 8B model and your 16GB VRAM, this will offload almost the entire model, making it run very fast.
-p "...": Your initial prompt.
You should see your GPU's memory usage jump, and the model will generate a response very quickly.

Step 5: Run llama.cpp as a Server
For your dbgcopilot project, you'll want to run it as a server that your dev container can connect to.

Start the server:
bash

./server -m ./Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf \
         --host 0.0.0.0 \
         --port 8080 \
         -c 4096 \
         -ngl 99
--host 0.0.0.0: This is crucial. It makes the server accessible from other devices on your network, including your dev container.
--port 8080: We'll run it on port 8080 to avoid conflicts with Ollama (which uses 11434).
Test the server from another WSL2 terminal:
Open a new WSL2 terminal and use curl to send a request:
bash

curl --request POST \
     --url http://127.0.0.1:8080/completion \
     --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data '{
       "prompt": "Building a house of cards. The first card is placed.",
       "n_predict": 128
     }'
You should get a JSON response back with the model's completion.
Step 6: Connect from Your Dev Container
Now you can point your dbgcopilot code in the dev container to this new server. The llama.cpp server provides an OpenAI-compatible API, which is fantastic because many existing libraries can talk to it.

You can use the openai Python library to connect to it.

# In your dbgcopilot code inside the dev container

# Point the client to your llama.cpp server on the host
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://host.docker.internal:8080/v1",
    api_key="not-needed" # The llama.cpp server doesn't require a real key
)

# Now use the client just like you would with the real OpenAI API
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="local-model",  # The model name can be anything, llama.cpp ignores it
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful debugging assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Why did my program crash? Here is the backtrace: ..."}
    ],
    temperature=0.7,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
You have now successfully set up llama.cpp as a powerful, local LLM server that you can control with fine-grained detail, ready to be integrated into your development workflow
